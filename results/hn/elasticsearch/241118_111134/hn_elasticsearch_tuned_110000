The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so.

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of ""I've not once ever had to implement quicksort""). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time.

By sketchy, I mean that they may offend someone of a particular set, but are otherwise (in my opinion) brilliant executions that I'm proud of. I've never done anything illegal, and I like to think I have a solid base of ethics.<p>For example, when I was around 17, I picked up a trademarked domain for a popular music group from expiry (they didn't own it prior, was just a holding page for non-related topic). I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for ""bling"" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate.

Like Wiles announcing a proof (later shown to be flawed) of Fermat&#x27;s last theorem at a lecture in Cambridge&#x27;s Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences in 1993. It is immensely helpful to talk through the proof in person facing an audience of experts.","shas3","6","17","12"";s:13:"log.file.path";s:14:"/data/data.csv";s:12:"story_author";s:12:"robinhouston";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:12;s:8:"story_id";i:10348617;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:5;a:11:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:258;s:14:"comment_author";s:7:"frankus";s:10:"comment_id";i:1577292;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:32;s:12:"comment_text";s:805:"Mine's a WiFi-only 16GB model that I've had since day one.

I've never done anything illegal, and I like to think I have a solid base of ethics.<p>For example, when I was around 17, I picked up a trademarked domain for a popular music group from expiry (they didn't own it prior, was just a holding page for non-related topic). I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for ""bling"" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate. I offered email service, networked with other hip hop sites, and made about $100k from adsense before I was graciously C&#38;D'd and handed the name over.<p>Most recently I cofounded a project that was covered on the sites of TIME, CBS, Business Insider, Gawker, and pending an ABC News article. It made the front page of HN as well (thanks guys). That site was Price Of Weed, where we crowdsource and share information about the price people pay for marijuana. Possession is still illegal in most of the world; its easy to assume I'm some sort of stoner/drug pusher because I'm associated with this project, but in reality I don't smoke much at all.<p>Now I'm a biz guy and probably won't be applying to jobs at big corporations. I'd really like to work for a startup, which I believe would be less judgmental and more accepting of my project history. If you were me, would you stick these projects on your resume?

The majority of my students are experienced programmers, but no small number are new to programming beyond very simple stuff.   I&#x27;ve found that Python has a number of aspects that are ideal for first-time programmers:<p>- It&#x27;s dynamically typed.  Say what you want about static vs. dynamic typing, but this is one less thing that newbie programmers have to get right.  There&#x27;s no chance of an error when they say &quot;i = &#x27;abc&#x27;&quot;, if you&#x27;ve defined i to be an int.<p>- It&#x27;s interactive.  The fact that you can &quot;play&quot; with the language within the interactive shell is a huge selling point.  IPython and the IPython Notebook are easy to get working, and for people to work with.<p>- Python&#x27;s restricted command set and simple, regular syntax let you concentrate on ideas: Yes, many newbies to Python (and to programming in general) get confused by indentation, blocks, colons, and the like.  But they&#x27;re going to get confused by the syntax of nearly any language.  Python has a simpler syntax than most other languages, meaning that there&#x27;s less to learn, and less to remember.  This lets the new programmer concentrate on the ideas that they&#x27;re learning, or the implementation of what they&#x27;re doing.<p>- It&#x27;s cross platform.  The fact that people can use Python on any computer they like is a big selling point.<p>- You can easily teach object-oriented and functional-style programming.  Python is obviously object-oriented, but can also be used to introduce functional programming.

The majority of my students are experienced programmers, but no small number are new to programming beyond very simple stuff.   I&#x27;ve found that Python has a number of aspects that are ideal for first-time programmers:<p>- It&#x27;s dynamically typed.  Say what you want about static vs. dynamic typing, but this is one less thing that newbie programmers have to get right.  There&#x27;s no chance of an error when they say &quot;i = &#x27;abc&#x27;&quot;, if you&#x27;ve defined i to be an int.<p>- It&#x27;s interactive.  The fact that you can &quot;play&quot; with the language within the interactive shell is a huge selling point.  IPython and the IPython Notebook are easy to get working, and for people to work with.<p>- Python&#x27;s restricted command set and simple, regular syntax let you concentrate on ideas: Yes, many newbies to Python (and to programming in general) get confused by indentation, blocks, colons, and the like.  But they&#x27;re going to get confused by the syntax of nearly any language.  Python has a simpler syntax than most other languages, meaning that there&#x27;s less to learn, and less to remember.  This lets the new programmer concentrate on the ideas that they&#x27;re learning, or the implementation of what they&#x27;re doing.<p>- It&#x27;s cross platform.  The fact that people can use Python on any computer they like is a big selling point.<p>- You can easily teach object-oriented and functional-style programming.  Python is obviously object-oriented, but can also be used to introduce functional programming.  In this way, you can expose programmers not only to multiple paradigms in Python, but also in other languages.<p>- You can use it for real applications.  People are often surprised to discover that real-life applications are being written and used in this language that they&#x27;re learning, which seems so simple.<p>I&#x27;m sure that there are more reasons than these.

So, let's say that you have an Article model.<p><pre><code>  class Article &#60; ActiveRecord::Base
  end
</code></pre>
There's no need to do things like 1) tell it which database table to use; 2) tell it the setters and getters you want.  Those can be inferred.  Well, it's called Article so it'll use the articles table and we're going to want a setter and getter for each column.<p>Now, that can be overridden.  You can call set_table_name to explicitly tell it to use a table, you can add additional methods, you can override the default setters and getters, etc.  That's the idea behind Rails. You need a programming language to describe the decisions you're making that affect how your application works, but for a lot of things you're doing the same thing over and over and there's no reason to keep doing the same thing over and over.<p>Let's say that you wanted to (by default) order the articles by their creation date:<p><pre><code>  class Article &#60; ActiveRecord::Base
    default_scope :order =&#62; "created_at DESC"
  end
</code></pre>
You've now defined some business logic so that when you call Article.all, you get them in that order.  On the models, you can define any amount of logic you want by creating instance or class methods.  In fact, all of those fancy keywords are just mix-ins - method calls that add methods to your class.<p>This is why it looks like Rails is lacking a bit of business.  When you call belongs_to :apple, the belongs_to method gets executed as the class is interpreted and that belongs_to method is something like:<p><pre><code>  def belongs_to(associated)
    define_method associated do
      associated.to_s.camelize.constantize.find(send("#{associated}_id"))
    end
    define_method "#{associated}=" do |val|
      send("#{associated}_id=", val.id)
    end
  end
</code></pre>
Now, it's more complicated than that (since belongs_to adds some additional features), but that's the basic premise.  You have this foreign key association and, most often, it's a simple association where you want to define a setter and a getter for that association.  So, the belongs_to method takes the name and pops out two methods based on that name.  The first is the getter and it makes the name you input into a camel-case and gets the constant with that name.  It calls the find method on that constant and inputs the foreign key value to the find method.  Likewise, the setter (setters in Ruby are methods that end with the equals sign) and sets the "name underscore id" attribute on the model to the id of the associated object.<p>But you could just as easily define the methods yourself in the Article class rather than using the helper mix-in. Likewise, if you have business logic that doesn't fit in with what's already made, you can define any methods you want on your model classes.<p>The same goes for controllers.  Controllers can be pretty small.  If you're just trying to get the latest 10 articles, there isn't a lot you have to do - you need to fetch them from the database and store them in a variable.  This is another one of those areas where Rails doesn't ask you for things it can assume.  Instance variables (which start with the "@" symbol) get passed to the template, local variables (which have no prefix) don't go to the template.  The template that gets rendered is the one named "controller/action".  Of course, you can override that and call render :template =&#62; "xyz/abc" if you like.<p>I'm sorry if this seems a little all over the place, but I'm not sure what kind of business logic you're looking to implement.  If you give me an example, I can provide some insight.  However, from what you've said, it looks like you've just seen the basics of what models can do - and that's because a lot of the intro code is "let's build a blog" where there isn't a ton of business logic.  But you can make any methods (class or instance) you like to do things to your data.  Rails creates the basic cases for you - because the basic cases are well-understood.  However, you can make them more complex:<p><pre><code>  class Article &#60; ActiveRecord::Base

Of course, you can override that and call render :template =&#62; ""xyz/abc"" if you like.<p>I'm sorry if this seems a little all over the place, but I'm not sure what kind of business logic you're looking to implement.  If you give me an example, I can provide some insight.  However, from what you've said, it looks like you've just seen the basics of what models can do - and that's because a lot of the intro code is ""let's build a blog"" where there isn't a ton of business logic.  But you can make any methods (class or instance) you like to do things to your data.  Rails creates the basic cases for you - because the basic cases are well-understood.  However, you can make them more complex:<p><pre><code>  class Article &#60; ActiveRecord::Base
    def title
      if Time.now.day == 1 and Time.now.month == 4
        return title.reverse
      else
        return title
      end
    end

So, let's say that you have an Article model.<p><pre><code>  class Article &#60; ActiveRecord::Base
  end
</code></pre>
There's no need to do things like 1) tell it which database table to use; 2) tell it the setters and getters you want.  Those can be inferred.  Well, it's called Article so it'll use the articles table and we're going to want a setter and getter for each column.<p>Now, that can be overridden.  You can call set_table_name to explicitly tell it to use a table, you can add additional methods, you can override the default setters and getters, etc.  That's the idea behind Rails. You need a programming language to describe the decisions you're making that affect how your application works, but for a lot of things you're doing the same thing over and over and there's no reason to keep doing the same thing over and over.<p>Let's say that you wanted to (by default) order the articles by their creation date:<p><pre><code>  class Article &#60; ActiveRecord::Base
    default_scope :order =&#62; "created_at DESC"
  end
</code></pre>
You've now defined some business logic so that when you call Article.all, you get them in that order.  On the models, you can define any amount of logic you want by creating instance or class methods.  In fact, all of those fancy keywords are just mix-ins - method calls that add methods to your class.<p>This is why it looks like Rails is lacking a bit of business.  When you call belongs_to :apple, the belongs_to method gets executed as the class is interpreted and that belongs_to method is something like:<p><pre><code>  def belongs_to(associated)
    define_method associated do
      associated.to_s.camelize.constantize.find(send("#{associated}_id"))
    end
    define_method "#{associated}=" do |val|
      send("#{associated}_id=", val.id)
    end
  end
</code></pre>
Now, it's more complicated than that (since belongs_to adds some additional features), but that's the basic premise.  You have this foreign key association and, most often, it's a simple association where you want to define a setter and a getter for that association.  So, the belongs_to method takes the name and pops out two methods based on that name.  The first is the getter and it makes the name you input into a camel-case and gets the constant with that name.  It calls the find method on that constant and inputs the foreign key value to the find method.  Likewise, the setter (setters in Ruby are methods that end with the equals sign) and sets the "name underscore id" attribute on the model to the id of the associated object.<p>But you could just as easily define the methods yourself in the Article class rather than using the helper mix-in. Likewise, if you have business logic that doesn't fit in with what's already made, you can define any methods you want on your model classes.<p>The same goes for controllers.  Controllers can be pretty small.  If you're just trying to get the latest 10 articles, there isn't a lot you have to do - you need to fetch them from the database and store them in a variable.  This is another one of those areas where Rails doesn't ask you for things it can assume.  Instance variables (which start with the "@" symbol) get passed to the template, local variables (which have no prefix) don't go to the template.  The template that gets rendered is the one named "controller/action".  Of course, you can override that and call render :template =&#62; "xyz/abc" if you like.<p>I'm sorry if this seems a little all over the place, but I'm not sure what kind of business logic you're looking to implement.  If you give me an example, I can provide some insight.  However, from what you've said, it looks like you've just seen the basics of what models can do - and that's because a lot of the intro code is "let's build a blog" where there isn't a ton of business logic.  But you can make any methods (class or instance) you like to do things to your data.  Rails creates the basic cases for you - because the basic cases are well-understood.

My age never really came up until I was there for a while and at that point I was 17 or so and the owner ended up getting out of the business and I split off with some others and we formed our own company doing the same thing (although a bit better). We ended up growing the firm to $250,000 in revenues with a great profit margin, however at that point we became distracted and complacent (I was enjoying college, the head ""techie"" partner was rapidly advancing in his day job as a programmer, people got married and had first kids etc.) and more or less let the business die down.<p>I've played with a few other startup ideas since then related to the same niche I had experience in (one was doing fine, but I didn't have the passion for it and couldn't deliver a product/service that I thought was good enough so shut it down; another I started last summer and the business model works and it is generating maybe a steady $10-20 a day, but that is only with about 100 unique users a day..it's very scalable and is designed to be a semi-passive cash cow but am having trouble bringing in the traffic; if I could get 1,000 <i>targeted</i> uniques a day probably about $100/day and so on).

All the roles are so specialized and bureaucratic, it's very 8-5 cubicle work, and there just seems to be a constant ""cog in the machine"" alienation from the work that is being done and the finished product.

I apologize about the length of this, you can skip to the end for the question if you are short on time, but would really be grateful for any responses as I really value the HN community.<p>Background:<p>I'm 21 and currently approaching the final year of my undergraduate degree at the University of Virginia. I'm a business major at the McIntire school which is fairly respected (http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/rankings/index.html) and concentrating in management with a sort of sub-track in a newly launched entrepreneurship program that I'm excited about (co-taught by some entrepreneur alumni). The business program is a two year program and I came out of high school with enough college credits that I've been able to take more or less any classes I've been interested in (mostly Philosophy, Political theory, Psychology.. I seem to like the P's). I absolutely love the college academic environment as I love learning. As a result I've done excellent in school all while managing to have sometimes too much fun in the process.<p>I got involved with my first web based start-up when I was 13/14. I saw a business model (niche market, digital product related), thought I could do a better job, and more or less copied it. Within a year I ended merging and working with the business I copied. My age never really came up until I was there for a while and at that point I was 17 or so and the owner ended up getting out of the business and I split off with some others and we formed our own company doing the same thing (although a bit better). We ended up growing the firm to $250,000 in revenues with a great profit margin, however at that point we became distracted and complacent (I was enjoying college, the head "techie" partner was rapidly advancing in his day job as a programmer, people got married and had first kids etc.) and more or less let the business die down.<p>I've played with a few other startup ideas since then related to the same niche I had experience in (one was doing fine, but I didn't have the passion for it and couldn't deliver a product/service that I thought was good enough so shut it down; another I started last summer and the business model works and it is generating maybe a steady $10-20 a day, but that is only with about 100 unique users a day..it's very scalable and is designed to be a semi-passive cash cow but am having trouble bringing in the traffic; if I could get 1,000 <i>targeted</i> uniques a day probably about $100/day and so on). I just recently bought out a partner of the original start-up and am trying to bring it back to where it was before. However, the competition is a lot stronger now, and I'm a bit burned out of the business and would probably prefer to work on other things.<p>In this process I've managed to save about 100k in cash/liquid assets that aren't in a Roth IRA or anything like..and I have my expenses for next year (class/rent/food) covered. The question deals with what to do with those assets...<p>The Question Arises:<p>This summer I'm interning at a global high tech physical manufacturing firm. Great brand name, the compensation is great, and I'm more or less doing a lot of financial analysis and writing whitepapers related to internal business processes and international banking. All the main projects I work on are fairly interesting (Even if most of my downtime I'm doing silly intern things like the occasional printing, photocopying, filing, or any work someone else doesn't want to do etc.) and I work with good people...but really don't seem to like working for a large corporation. All the roles are so specialized and bureaucratic, it's very 8-5 cubicle work, and there just seems to be a constant "cog in the machine" alienation from the work that is being done and the finished product. I've realized I really don't like that. That's partly because the finished product is unbelievably complex and there isn't really another way to setup the system, but I feel my early start-up experience has spoiled me and for the most part I dislike the job and could in no way see myself doing it for the rest of my life or even a year.<p>The Question:<p>So, I have one more year of school left to sort of prepare for my exit into the real world. Unlike most on HN I'm not much of a programmer (I tried to teach myself some C++ back when I was younger, but never really enjoyed it that much; I've recently been teaching myself the basics of Ruby because I got tired of hiring people to fix things, but not sure if I have a passion for it although enjoy learning it as of now...will see when I learn a bit more) although I am very technical and been working with/building and playing with old computers since I was probably about seven or eight years old.<p>I really want to move to a major city, and have wanted to move to the Silicon Valley area/region since I was a kid. I always felt like I was too young or left out of the early web boom (for better or worse). I'd probably love to move to San Francisco and get involved with some sort of start-up related work related to either web, tech, or finance.<p>However, I'm sort of torn as in a poor job market I'm lucky enough to attend a school with a nice almuni network and great recruiting right out of school. About 70% of my business school are finance majors and a great deal of them all go to Wall Street or the top Management Consulting Firms. I could see myself potentially doing that as I like finance, the markets, strategy, and the whole nature of closing and making big deals... but have this nagging feeling that if it weren't for the money or prestige that isn't what I would want to spend my life doing. I felt some of PG's essays pointed this out rather well.  When I did startup work... it just didn't feel like work and my currently internship feels a lot like work. However the paycheck is nice...<p>So, any ideas on what I should do with my remaining "vacation" from the real world in college or what I should do with the 100,000 in the bank? Any ideas on what to do after college?<p><i></i>Note: At the same time I can't help feeling how out of wack this question is with a world where many live on a $1 a day and a global GDP per capita of about $10,000/year and how lucky I am to have the opportunities I have had (especially on the 4th of July here in the U.S). It's something I've always felt a bit guilty about even though I've worked hard, because so many never had the chance that I had. For that very reason I've always had that sort of nagging feeling to really make the best use of what I've been given; hence this question.";}i:15;a:2:{s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:16;a:2:{s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:17;a:2:{s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:18;a:2:{s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:19;a:2:{s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}}s:5:"stats";s:0:"";s:8:"checksum";i:44241128;s:10:"warmupTime";d:30248;s:6:"retest";b:0;}i:26;a:15:{s:10:"avgFastest";i:10889;s:2:"cv";d:220.21;s:3:"avg";d:17406;s:12:"cvAvgFastest";d:12.55;s:4:"cold";d:391594;s:7:"fastest";d:9006;s:7:"slowest";d:391594;s:5:"times";a:100:{i:0;d:391594;i:1;d:33085;i:2;d:36028;i:3;d:28399;i:4;d:23929;i:5;d:22745;i:6;d:22499;i:7;d:23504;i:8;d:21606;i:9;d:19759;i:10;d:19718;i:11;d:18202;i:12;d:18064;i:13;d:16320;i:14;d:16642;i:15;d:17013;i:16;d:15505;i:17;d:15132;i:18;d:13358;i:19;d:14196;i:20;d:63890;i:21;d:19549;i:22;d:13746;i:23;d:12708;i:24;d:12833;i:25;d:12164;i:26;d:11361;i:27;d:11096;i:28;d:11624;i:29;d:11202;i:30;d:13223;i:31;d:12704;i:32;d:12689;i:33;d:11586;i:34;d:11227;i:35;d:11483;i:36;d:11434;i:37;d:11622;i:38;d:10790;i:39;d:10702;i:40;d:10445;i:41;d:11010;i:42;d:12257;i:43;d:11021;i:44;d:11546;i:45;d:10222;i:46;d:11255;i:47;d:10626;i:48;d:10349;i:49;d:9992;i:50;d:10387;i:51;d:11096;i:52;d:22311;i:53;d:10360;i:54;d:11387;i:55;d:10814;i:56;d:10766;i:57;d:10349;i:58;d:10867;i:59;d:10622;i:60;d:11413;i:61;d:11163;i:62;d:12258;i:63;d:13288;i:64;d:10558;i:65;d:9794;i:66;d:9635;i:67;d:10203;i:68;d:12289;i:69;d:9669;i:70;d:9851;i:71;d:9824;i:72;d:9725;i:73;d:9660;i:74;d:9753;i:75;d:9578;i:76;d:9499;i:77;d:9187;i:78;d:10078;i:79;d:9549;i:80;d:9694;i:81;d:9897;i:82;d:9968;i:83;d:10181;i:84;d:34637;i:85;d:10855;i:86;d:10236;i:87;d:10261;i:88;d:9817;i:89;d:9342;i:90;d:9270;i:91;d:9405;i:92;d:9859;i:93;d:9477;i:94;d:10338;i:95;d:10022;i:96;d:9777;i:97;d:9153;i:98;d:9006;i:99;d:9895;}s:13:"originalQuery";s:58:"select count(*) from hn where comment_ranking in (100,200)";s:13:"modifiedQuery";s:58:"select count(*) from hn where comment_ranking in (100,200)";s:6:"result";a:1:{i:0;a:1:{s:8:"count(*)";i:25200;}}s:5:"stats";s:0:"";s:8:"checksum";i:71705545;s:10:"warmupTime";d:30242;s:6:"retest";b:0;}i:27;a:15:{s:10:"avgFastest";i:691728;s:2:"cv";d:18.41;s:3:"avg";d:718369;s:12:"cvAvgFastest";d:0.45;s:4:"cold";d:1475702;s:7:"fastest";d:687370;s:7:"slowest";d:1475702;s:5:"times";a:34:{i:0;d:1475702;i:1;d:748062;i:2;d:695472;i:3;d:690129;i:4;d:704309;i:5;d:703581;i:6;d:704238;i:7;d:704811;i:8;d:697844;i:9;d:691922;i:10;d:697000;i:11;d:694103;i:12;d:691970;i:13;d:693242;i:14;d:692457;i:15;d:690217;i:16;d:692222;i:17;d:689537;i:18;d:688593;i:19;d:693109;i:20;d:697175;i:21;d:687800;i:22;d:691977;i:23;d:689904;i:24;d:688334;i:25;d:690327;i:26;d:688128;i:27;d:687370;i:28;d:692030;i:29;d:698128;i:30;d:707183;i:31;d:689217;i:32;d:689337;i:33;d:689133;}s:13:"originalQuery";s:128:"select story_id from hn order by comment_ranking asc, author_comment_count asc, story_comment_count asc, comment_id asc limit 20";s:13:"modifiedQuery";s:128:"select story_id from hn order by comment_ranking asc, author_comment_count asc, story_comment_count asc, comment_id asc limit 20";s:6:"result";a:20:{i:0;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:1;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:2;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:3;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:4;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:5;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:6;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:7;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:8;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:9;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:10;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:11;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:12;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:13;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:14;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:15;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:16;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:17;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:18;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}i:19;a:1:{s:8:"story_id";i:26150;}}s:5:"stats";s:0:"";s:8:"checksum";i:3240114460;s:10:"warmupTime";d:36293;s:6:"retest";b:0;}}s:7:"limited";i:0;s:8:"serverId";s:32:"9cb27f4d3c8d4331982e83e66c09a5ff";s:10:"serverInfo";a:9:{s:4:"argv";s:106:"../../test --test=hn --engines=elasticsearch:tuned --memory=110000 --query_timeout=600 --probe_timeout=600";s:7:"cpuInfo";s:50061:"processor	: 0
