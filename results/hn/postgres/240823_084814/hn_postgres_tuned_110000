It keeps people tied to your Service as a Software Substitute, and as long long as most people are still ignorant about how technology works, they won&#x27;t notice how the stalker-like nature of a lot of modern soft^H^H^H^Hmalware.<p>As for the few nerds that notice, they can probably be shut up with an obscure option to disable (most of?) the data collection; the number of people that even know the option exists will be insignificant. Some of those nerds can even be distracted with promises of &quot;open&quot; access (to our proprietary APIs we can remove or change without notice); if you phrase it right, it can even sound like &quot;open&quot; is referring to the commons. After a while, some of them may even build entire businesses based on feeding user surveillance data upstream. After a generation, the days of being able to write client software will be long forgotten.<p>--<p>The ongoing Theft Of Privacy (and the closely related The War On General Purpose Computing) are being fought, and this brazen behavior by Microsoft to take advantage user ignorance is taking yet another step down a dark path.<p>Which side are you going to be on? The side that is trying to maintain the remains of our privacy, an open internet, and free computing?<p>The apathetic side that fixes technical problems for themselves, while everybody else gets spied upon a little bit more while their tools become even more removed from their control? I hope you enjoy the consequences of rewarding this kind of behavior. Why should Microsoft (or anybody else) change when they still get paid and maintain their user-count?<p>Or are you the apparatchik, who thinks Cortana (or Alexa, or Siri, ... or Google Analytics) is a useful, cool piece of software? Surely the Big Data being collected is just going to be used for the stated purposes and could never have a noxious effect on users or become an attractive target for hackers or governments?

I sent emails to ~50 different companies (some well-known, others unknown) that were looking for "Sr. Developers", particularly Ruby devs, as found on the major developer job sites (stackoverflow, Dice, Indeed, 37signals etc). I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting. I also picked companies that most closely matched my skillset. In my email I introduced myself and included my resume. Here is how I am represented in the email (paraphrased from actual text, ):<p>Given: X &#62; 7 &#38; Y &#62; 4,<p>"Sr. Level Developer, with X years exp. Y years of prof exp with Ruby. Main expertise is in Ruby, API's, MySQL and a bunch of other stuff. Previously worked for 'ABC' startup ($X Millions angel backed) for two years and helped build out the entire app/platform etc. Later served as CTO for several side projects. I attended Top Tier University , ...  blah blah blah"<p>More stats:<p>Salary expectations: $115K<p>Areas of interest: API's, Analytics, SaaS, Telephony, Machine learning ....<p>Ability to relocate: Open to idea, can't right away<p>Telecommuter?: Pretty please<p>Snark level: Not nearly as high as this post ;)<p>Likeability: Very high<p>So out of ~50 companies that I tried contacting what was the result?<p>10/50 - sent me a reply email of some sort (confirmation, autoreply, whatever)<p>7/50 - tried to setup a phone screen<p>5/50 - actually completed the phone screen (with all phones screens going very well, I might add)<p>3/50 - tried to setup a technical interview<p>0/50 - actually completed a technical interview<p>0/50 - made offer!<p>From my 60 day simple experiment, I argue......<p>The top 5 reasons you are (probably) not hiring:<p>1. You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc". If you think of "Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting";}i:1;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"222";s:14:"comment_author";s:12:"fuzzythinker";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3352097";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"13";s:12:"comment_text";s:947:"Counter data:<p>semi-active search time span: ~4-5 weeks<p>where: just craigslist &#38; python.org<p>what: sr. level web frontend or backend<p>companies: all small/startups, but none are well known in HN<p>emails sent: I'm quite choosy actually, only applied to ~4 positions a week, which equates to ~20 sent.<p>results: ~75-80% replied,<p>out of those replied:

It is not really that weird. Puzzles or math problems are just a faster and highly probable measure of one's aptitude not just for the silly puzzle but how sharp you are even in business decisions. The mind has to be sharp.

Yes every tech worker&#x27;s salary will drop significantly if the United States allowed more open immigration laws.

Silicon Valley would prolly exist but wouldn&#x27;t have the monopoly on software that it has.<p>I am not an american but I am really happy that the united states government has strong anti-immigration laws. This might not be an popular opinion but the United States has mooched off talent from the rest of the world without paying for it. It has actually allowed rapid development of the start-up scene in my country who are in direct competition with the bay area. The best part is unlike the bay area most of the tech workers are able to save a majority of their money as the living cost is dirt cheap compared to the disgusting wealth extraction from the young and talented that happens in the bay area.<p>Now just for a second imagine if these tech hubs grow and take a large market share from the likes of google and facebook ?<p>As a student of Computer science who doesn&#x27;t happen to be the the united states all this is really good news and I wish the govt doesn&#x27;t listen to PG as it results in the 95% to  decentralize the wealth generated from technology from the hands of PG and silicon valley.

He&#x27;s chasing the vision with his own work, rather than jumping into someone else&#x27;s Magitek Armor and then deciding to burn Narshe.<p>Also, these asshats are the reason it&#x27;s so fucking hard for startups to get clients. Businesses (clients) have been burned, horribly, in the past by startups dropping them to chase dragons because their investors thought it a better idea to drop the client and roll the dice on some red-ocean product play with a 1-in-100 shot at success. This creates a world in which clients are very cautious about dealing with startups.<p>We&#x27;d have a better ecosystem if the VCs were just passive investors who didn&#x27;t try to live out their own adolescent do-the-world fantasies.

There&#x27;s a reason why Elon Musk is such an unstoppable force in the business world. Technical people have such a deep love of science and tech that they sometimes forget about the economic and political realities of modern western societies: capital rules all.<p>Understanding and managing time and capital is the most important task any individual is faced with in the western world. As I&#x27;ve said many times, every single person reading HN most likely undervalues their time, and ends up severely miscalculating their opportunity costs as a result. The nature of capitalism is such that taking risk is the only path forward, regardless of how many failures it results in.<p>As the commenters above have noted, very few become billionaires by working 9 to 5 for someone else. Work for yourself, and with equals (as co-founders). Never work as an employee. If you need to contract your services out, do it as a consultant on a milestone or hourly basis. Take absolute control of your time. No overtime, no crunch time, no favors.<p>Understand the system we operate in, and optimize for it. Don&#x27;t be sucked in by stupid hype, marketing, &quot;culture&quot;, free pop, ping pong tables, personality cults, or any such nonsense. Your time is worth just as much as the CEO&#x27;s.<p>I&#x27;m hoping that once the tech world wakes up to this reality, we&#x27;ll start exerting far more influence over big corps, big finance, and big government. This is the only way we can really change the world for the better. Not by being employees to big corps, but by running the show.<p>The Hacker mentality espouses efficiency and ingenuity. It&#x27;s nigh time we applied this to our lives. It&#x27;s not enough for me to do it on my own, everyone here needs to do this so that we can collectively exert influence to enact real change.<p>P.S. I know it may be hard to herd cats, but I&#x27;ve seen the community here rally around many great ideas. I want gigabit fiber everywhere, renewable energy cities, preventive genetic medicine for all, and colonies on Mars. Why haven&#x27;t these happened?

You shouldn't underestimate how many smart people there are working on world changing initiates, even in places like university labs.  Unfortunately world-changing research doesn't pay well.  Elon Musk on the other hand is a great example of hacking the system - making money the capitalist way, and then fund initiatives you want to be remembered for.  It's a risk-reward trade-off of course, but something tells me if you'd think you could walk away with 100M in 2 years from your startup and use the money to solve the world's water problem - you'd probably do that.

It was around the time of the "make poverty history" campaign. This guy went to Nigeria and tried to do a few basic things like get a house, find a job, etc. and found that at every turn he was faced by rampant corruption. He even setup an NGO and started accepting foreign aid with very little trouble.<p>The final line in the film is "If you want to solve poverty, you first have to solve corruption" which has always stuck with me.<p>I'm mentioning this because it may be the case that "solving the water problem" for the majority of people won't be a matter of the (relatively) simple application of technology, but a matter of the much more complex application of political will, diplomacy and grass roots activism.

The subtle difference is that even if you don't disclose on your resume, you need to consider whether they would be ok if they found out post-hire.

By sketchy, I mean that they may offend someone of a particular set, but are otherwise (in my opinion) brilliant executions that I'm proud of. I've never done anything illegal, and I like to think I have a solid base of ethics.<p>For example, when I was around 17, I picked up a trademarked domain for a popular music group from expiry (they didn't own it prior, was just a holding page for non-related topic). I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for "bling" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate. I offered email service, networked with other hip hop sites, and made about $100k from adsense before I was graciously C&#38;D'd and handed the name over.<p>Most recently I cofounded a project that was covered on the sites of TIME, CBS, Business Insider, Gawker, and pending an ABC News article. It made the front page of HN as well (thanks guys). That site was Price Of Weed, where we crowdsource and share information about the price people pay for marijuana. Possession is still illegal in most of the world; its easy to assume I'm some sort of stoner/drug pusher because I'm associated with this project, but in reality I don't smoke much at all.<p>Now I'm a biz guy and probably won't be applying to jobs at big corporations. I'd really like to work for a startup, which I believe would be less judgmental and more accepting of my project history. If you were me, would you stick these projects on your resume?

Dunning-Kruger[0] is real, and your post doesn't demonstrate the self-awareness the best developers seem to possess.<p>Your writing is sprinkled with emoticons and rife with reduplicated punctuation, both of which (especially the exclamation points) are common signs of immaturity.  Reading this diatribe--and assuming your 50 emails were written similarly--I am forced to accept one of two conclusions: either you're not aware that your writing is unprofessional, or you're aware that it's unprofessional and unconcerned.  Either option does not reflect well on you.  To put it bluntly, if I received an email from you in this style, I would archive it without response, assuming it was from someone who lacked the requisite introspective capability I expect from the people I want to work with.<p>I found it particularly telling that you claim that all five of your phone screens went "very well" but marveled that only three companies tried to set up an onsite interview with you.  Unless both the two companies that stopped at the phone screen simultaneously filled the position immediately after your phone screen, you really need to recognize that at least those two phone screens did not go well.  I do interviews at a large Internet company, and one of my goals--one of the goals that I've been trained to seek--is to ensure that the candidate, no matter how bad, walks away from the interview feeling good about himself/herself and the company.  If you're doing really poorly in an interview, I'll toss you some easier questions than I normally give, because I have all the information I need, and I don't want you to have a negative experience with my company.  You may have felt good about the phone screens, but the most likely explanation for the two companies that didn't bring you onsite is that you didn't actually do well enough to justify additional interviews.  These people <i>want</i> to hire someone, and if you were someone they wanted to hire, they certainly <i>would</i> have continued to interview you.<p>I think your experiment was less valid than you think it was because you're less competent than you think you are.<p>EDIT: I should add that whatever the case, whether I'm right or wrong about you, the best response to the situation you're in is to seek to improve yourself, not to embark on a quixotic venture to change others.  Read CS theory books, create and modify open source projects, solve fun programming puzzles: sharpen your skills and--no matter what your level of competency--your prospects will improve.<p>[0] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"up_and_up";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"61";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3351699";s:10:"story_text";s:4263:"TL;DR version: When developer talent sends you an email, you fail to reply!!!<p>==========<p>Full Version:<p>To all the startups and companies whining about lack of developer talent, I call your bluff.<p>I ran a little experiment over the last 60 days. I sent emails to ~50 different companies (some well-known, others unknown) that were looking for "Sr. Developers", particularly Ruby devs, as found on the major developer job sites (stackoverflow, Dice, Indeed, 37signals etc). I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting.

You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc".

We're a long way away from a real cure, but survival rates have never been higher.<p>- Incredible advances in arthroscopic &#38; noninvasive/outpatient surgery &#38; procedures: In 2004-ish I blew out the "terrible triad" of knee ligaments; my surgery scars are just little dots.

Really. I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on.

My personal view is that I think by the time you bring someone in for an interview, you should already know that they can code, whether that&#x27;s through code samples they provide or through Github accounts or whatever.<p><i></i>TL;DR; Don&#x27;t waste your applicants time or your own<i></i><p>## The Interview
Interviewing should have two parts, imo:<p>* Confirming that I actually wrote the code I sent you and know what it means<p>* Confirming that you want to sit next to me for the next six months<p>I can tell you right now that if I take time off my current job to go sit in your office for an interview and you ask me basic questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; or &quot;What&#x27;s the difference between a POST and a GET request?&quot;, I&#x27;m going to thank you for your time and walk right out.<p>Why? Because my Github profile, which is featured prominently on my resume, contains examples of both. Half my projects are MVC projects, and many of them use 3rd party APIs (or are even APIs themselves!). The fact that you&#x27;re asking me basic definitions means you didn&#x27;t even pay attention to the stuff I sent you, so you&#x27;re wasting my time and yours. You could have already figured this out ahead of time. Instead, you asked me to take time out of my day (probably during work hours) to ask questions whose answers I&#x27;ve already provided.<p>(Please note that this only really goes for non-entry-level positions. For entry-level applicants, such as kids fresh out of college, you may not have very many code samples to work with. That&#x27;s fine. In that case, send some problems for them to work on at home. Hopefully, these are dumbed-down but real-world problems your company has faced in the past.)<p>## Phone Screen (aka verifying authenticity)<p>The first thing you should do is take a gander at my Github profile or my code samples. Then you call me up at a prearranged time and ask me questions about that code. Make me prove that I wrote what I said I wrote.<p>* I noticed you made this combat simulator (www.bitfalls.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;autofight-php-job-interview-task-part-1.html). Walk me through your thought process.<p>* Your code appears to be a custom MVC. Why did you choose to go with a custom one versus say, CodeIgniter or Symfony?<p>* This project is an API for Nerd Nite scheduling. First of all, what&#x27;s Nerd Nite and why did you make an API for it? Second, explain how you scraped the data, organized it, and output the results.<p>The above three questions will give you way more insight into my programming style and thought process than &quot;What is an MVC?&quot;. Please. Don&#x27;t waste my time. As a senior engineer with 7+ years in the field, I shouldn&#x27;t need to prove the equivalent of my ABCs to you. It should be understood.<p>I personally would also skip the whole &quot;live coding&quot; thing via Stypi or whatever. Waste of time, imo. You&#x27;ve already got code samples and you can ask me as many questions as you want about it. I shouldn&#x27;t need to write code in front of you to establish my credentials.<p>## What about people who lie?<p>There are people who lie about their resume and their qualifications, but that&#x27;s exactly why you should tailor your questions to fit the code samples provided. If I don&#x27;t get excited about that code and I can&#x27;t eloquently explain why I did what I did or how it works, then maybe I didn&#x27;t write it after all. It also gives you an insight as to my personality: I clearly took time out of my day to write this code. Why? What prompted me to write an API for Nerd Nite schedules?<p>The answers to those questions should give you an idea of whether I can actually program or not. Questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; can be looked up in a dictionary. Explaining code samples is much more difficult.<p>## What next?<p>Once you&#x27;ve established that I wrote the code I said I wrote, then Step 1 of The Interviewing process is mostly done. Now you bring me into the office to determine Step 2 -- am I someone you want sitting next to you for 8+ hours a day for the next six months? Do I fit in with company culture?<p>You could give me a problem to solve on the spot, but hopefully it&#x27;s more of a higher level thing rather than a &quot;write code on a whiteboard&quot; thing. The reason I say this is because at this point you should already have seen my code. You should know by now that I can build a class. The question you need to answer now is: given an arbitrary problem, can I solve it or at least come up with a reasonable thought process?<p>Bonus points if it&#x27;s relevant to the job. (i.e., if your job never requires you to write binary trees from scratch, don&#x27;t ask the applicant to do so.)<p>## Finally<p>Between the phone screen (technical) and in-person interview (personal), you should have a good idea of whether you want me on your team or not.<p>Occasionally for small teams, you may decide that you need to know something about time, creativity, independence, and other similar qualities that you can&#x27;t really get from code samples. If this is the case, then I suggest doing the contract thing, where you give them an assignment on contract. Once the assignment is finished, you hire them or pay them for the work completed (or hopefully both).<p>I really, really, really despise whiteboard coding. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s indicative of anything, and I think you will find a lot of false negatives (i.e., rule out good candidates) using the whiteboard method.<p>A few other thoughts:<p>* I should meet my potential future boss at the in-person interview<p>* I should meet at least one of my potential future coworkers<p>* Be respectful of my time. Most interviews take place during work hours, so I&#x27;ve taken time off work -- and probably lied to my boss about where I&#x27;m going! -- to meet with you. The least you can do is not waste my time.<p>* Be familiar with my resume and code samples. I took the time to write them, you should take the time to read them. It will answer way more questions about my abilities than a 20 minute quiz on technical terms will.<p>The more informal the in-person interview is, the better. The technical qualifications should already be accepted by the time I walk in the door. At this point, it&#x27;s a two way street as we figure out whether we want to work together. I&#x27;m interviewing you just as much as you are interviewing me.<p>(Note: These are just my opinions about how I interview others. It hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. On the other hand, almost every job I&#x27;ve ever interviewed for has completely wasted my time on that front.)";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"gameguy43";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"26";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"6559404";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:12;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"17";s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"nathannecro";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"8408494";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2138:"Please HN, there are a few comments in this thread talking about &quot;taking action&quot; if you happen to be a bystander during an emergency.<p>Let me implore you. If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment. Some of that equipment is located onboard a fire truck or an ambulance. Most of that equipment is usually found inside the operating room of your local hospital.

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5834687";s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for "bling" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate. I offered email service, networked with other hip hop sites, and made about $100k from adsense before I was graciously C&#38;D'd and handed the name over.<p>Most recently I cofounded a project that was covered on the sites of TIME, CBS, Business Insider, Gawker, and pending an ABC News article.

I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting. I also picked companies that most closely matched my skillset. In my email I introduced myself and included my resume. Here is how I am represented in the email (paraphrased from actual text, ):<p>Given: X &#62; 7 &#38; Y &#62; 4,<p>"Sr. Level Developer, with X years exp. Y years of prof exp with Ruby. Main expertise is in Ruby, API's, MySQL and a bunch of other stuff. Previously worked for 'ABC' startup ($X Millions angel backed) for two years and helped build out the entire app/platform etc. Later served as CTO for several side projects. I attended Top Tier University , ...  blah blah blah"<p>More stats:<p>Salary expectations: $115K<p>Areas of interest: API's, Analytics, SaaS, Telephony, Machine learning ....<p>Ability to relocate: Open to idea, can't right away<p>Telecommuter?: Pretty please<p>Snark level: Not nearly as high as this post ;)<p>Likeability: Very high<p>So out of ~50 companies that I tried contacting what was the result?<p>10/50 - sent me a reply email of some sort (confirmation, autoreply, whatever)<p>7/50 - tried to setup a phone screen<p>5/50 - actually completed the phone screen (with all phones screens going very well, I might add)<p>3/50 - tried to setup a technical interview<p>0/50 - actually completed a technical interview<p>0/50 - made offer!<p>From my 60 day simple experiment, I argue......<p>The top 5 reasons you are (probably) not hiring:<p>1. You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc". If you think of "Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting";}i:7;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"gkefalas";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1038662";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1830:"In terms of medical advances, there may not have been any major blockbuster disease cures found, but there were several very important advances &#38; innovations.

We're a long way away from a real cure, but survival rates have never been higher.<p>- Incredible advances in arthroscopic &#38; noninvasive/outpatient surgery &#38; procedures: In 2004-ish I blew out the "terrible triad" of knee ligaments; my surgery scars are just little dots. My brother had similar surgery just about 6-8 years prior to that, and he bears the ugly long scar over his kneecap.<p>That's just gleaned from one decade-end retrospective article, and is just focused on medical advances.<p>But also, stop and think back to the internet in 2000 versus where we are now. There's been a hell of a lot of innovation there, as well; think of all of the things that are now possible or even commonplace to do online that were merely a gleam in our minds a decade ago...<p>If anything, just thinking about the pieces and foundations that were put in place throughout the 00s excites me for the possibilities of this next decade even more.

Really. I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on. Either way, no one is forced into anything.<p>Couple of others useful links with details on this:<p>[0] <a href="http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/view/story.jhtml?id=534355695&amp;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hreonline.com&#x2F;HRE&#x2F;view&#x2F;story.jhtml?id=534355695&amp;</a><p>[1] <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/tag/performance-review" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.adobe.com&#x2F;conversations&#x2F;tag&#x2F;performance-review</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"tmbsundar";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"16";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7196536";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:10;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"277";s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"dazzawazza";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4447905";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:242:"It's good to see both the BBC and ABC being level headed about this.<p>Serving your paying customers and enticing pirates towards being paying customers is how ALL rights holders should behave.<p>It's been all stick and no carrot for so long.";s:12:"story_author";s:8:"iProject";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4447838";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:11;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"232";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"Jemaclus";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"6560445";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:6754:"Here&#x27;s where I think I diverge from most people on this topic. My personal view is that I think by the time you bring someone in for an interview, you should already know that they can code, whether that&#x27;s through code samples they provide or through Github accounts or whatever.<p><i></i>TL;DR; Don&#x27;t waste your applicants time or your own<i></i><p>## The Interview
Interviewing should have two parts, imo:<p>* Confirming that I actually wrote the code I sent you and know what it means<p>* Confirming that you want to sit next to me for the next six months<p>I can tell you right now that if I take time off my current job to go sit in your office for an interview and you ask me basic questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; or &quot;What&#x27;s the difference between a POST and a GET request?&quot;, I&#x27;m going to thank you for your time and walk right out.<p>Why? Because my Github profile, which is featured prominently on my resume, contains examples of both. Half my projects are MVC projects, and many of them use 3rd party APIs (or are even APIs themselves!). The fact that you&#x27;re asking me basic definitions means you didn&#x27;t even pay attention to the stuff I sent you, so you&#x27;re wasting my time and yours. You could have already figured this out ahead of time. Instead, you asked me to take time out of my day (probably during work hours) to ask questions whose answers I&#x27;ve already provided.<p>(Please note that this only really goes for non-entry-level positions. For entry-level applicants, such as kids fresh out of college, you may not have very many code samples to work with. That&#x27;s fine. In that case, send some problems for them to work on at home. Hopefully, these are dumbed-down but real-world problems your company has faced in the past.)<p>## Phone Screen (aka verifying authenticity)<p>The first thing you should do is take a gander at my Github profile or my code samples. Then you call me up at a prearranged time and ask me questions about that code. Make me prove that I wrote what I said I wrote.<p>* I noticed you made this combat simulator (www.bitfalls.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;autofight-php-job-interview-task-part-1.html). Walk me through your thought process.<p>* Your code appears to be a custom MVC. Why did you choose to go with a custom one versus say, CodeIgniter or Symfony?<p>* This project is an API for Nerd Nite scheduling. First of all, what&#x27;s Nerd Nite and why did you make an API for it? Second, explain how you scraped the data, organized it, and output the results.<p>The above three questions will give you way more insight into my programming style and thought process than &quot;What is an MVC?&quot;. Please. Don&#x27;t waste my time. As a senior engineer with 7+ years in the field, I shouldn&#x27;t need to prove the equivalent of my ABCs to you. It should be understood.<p>I personally would also skip the whole &quot;live coding&quot; thing via Stypi or whatever. Waste of time, imo. You&#x27;ve already got code samples and you can ask me as many questions as you want about it. I shouldn&#x27;t need to write code in front of you to establish my credentials.<p>## What about people who lie?<p>There are people who lie about their resume and their qualifications, but that&#x27;s exactly why you should tailor your questions to fit the code samples provided. If I don&#x27;t get excited about that code and I can&#x27;t eloquently explain why I did what I did or how it works, then maybe I didn&#x27;t write it after all. It also gives you an insight as to my personality: I clearly took time out of my day to write this code. Why? What prompted me to write an API for Nerd Nite schedules?<p>The answers to those questions should give you an idea of whether I can actually program or not. Questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; can be looked up in a dictionary. Explaining code samples is much more difficult.<p>## What next?<p>Once you&#x27;ve established that I wrote the code I said I wrote, then Step 1 of The Interviewing process is mostly done. Now you bring me into the office to determine Step 2 -- am I someone you want sitting next to you for 8+ hours a day for the next six months? Do I fit in with company culture?<p>You could give me a problem to solve on the spot, but hopefully it&#x27;s more of a higher level thing rather than a &quot;write code on a whiteboard&quot; thing. The reason I say this is because at this point you should already have seen my code. You should know by now that I can build a class. The question you need to answer now is: given an arbitrary problem, can I solve it or at least come up with a reasonable thought process?<p>Bonus points if it&#x27;s relevant to the job. (i.e., if your job never requires you to write binary trees from scratch, don&#x27;t ask the applicant to do so.)<p>## Finally<p>Between the phone screen (technical) and in-person interview (personal), you should have a good idea of whether you want me on your team or not.<p>Occasionally for small teams, you may decide that you need to know something about time, creativity, independence, and other similar qualities that you can&#x27;t really get from code samples. If this is the case, then I suggest doing the contract thing, where you give them an assignment on contract. Once the assignment is finished, you hire them or pay them for the work completed (or hopefully both).<p>I really, really, really despise whiteboard coding. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s indicative of anything, and I think you will find a lot of false negatives (i.e., rule out good candidates) using the whiteboard method.<p>A few other thoughts:<p>* I should meet my potential future boss at the in-person interview<p>* I should meet at least one of my potential future coworkers<p>* Be respectful of my time. Most interviews take place during work hours, so I&#x27;ve taken time off work -- and probably lied to my boss about where I&#x27;m going! -- to meet with you. The least you can do is not waste my time.<p>* Be familiar with my resume and code samples. I took the time to write them, you should take the time to read them. It will answer way more questions about my abilities than a 20 minute quiz on technical terms will.<p>The more informal the in-person interview is, the better. The technical qualifications should already be accepted by the time I walk in the door. At this point, it&#x27;s a two way street as we figure out whether we want to work together. I&#x27;m interviewing you just as much as you are interviewing me.<p>(Note: These are just my opinions about how I interview others. It hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. On the other hand, almost every job I&#x27;ve ever interviewed for has completely wasted my time on that front.)";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"gameguy43";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"26";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"6559404";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:12;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"17";s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"nathannecro";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"8408494";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2138:"Please HN, there are a few comments in this thread talking about &quot;taking action&quot; if you happen to be a bystander during an emergency.<p>Let me implore you. If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment. Some of that equipment is located onboard a fire truck or an ambulance. Most of that equipment is usually found inside the operating room of your local hospital.

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5834687";s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

It's a relatively shallow learning curve from Java to Python to JavaScript, but making the leap to a pure functional language is very difficult.  Path-dependence plays a huge part here.  This isn't just a matter of "people being afraid of what's different" as the article suggests; there are very rational reasons for a profit-seeking firm to exploit the fact that their developers (and those available to hire) are already relatively proficient at writing procedural code.<p>Another, more important reason, is that Haskell is too intellectually demanding for most industrial programmers.  I consider myself an enthusiast of functional programming, but achieving anything practical using purely functional code remains extremely difficult for me, even though I regularly dabble in it during my free time.  The Haskell IRC channel can be helpful, but it's very difficult to square "Haskell is easy enough for anyone to learn" with the inevitable "you are too stupid/impatient/incompetent to use Haskell effectively" taunts you're likely to hear, when you're asking for help to perform a simple task.  Many Haskell evangelists don't understand that most developers aren't nearly as smart or dedicated as they are.<p>I'd be curious to know where most Haskell users believe they lie on the distribution of programming ability.  I'd estimate most of them lie at the 99% percentile, and that any of them arguing otherwise are doing so out of modesty.  (Note that I'd include dedication and curiosity in with intelligence in this metric.)

Things are not organizing better than they "ought" to, they've just happened to organize to a sufficient point that we exist and perceive this process and say things about it like the above quote.<p>It is in the same way that someone who wins the lottery must think themselves exceedingly lucky that they, of all the millions of people participating, have won. They must think there is something mysterious about this, that things turned out somewhat better than they 'ought' to, just on the basis of blind chance.<p>Yet, what is the probability that some person, of the entire pool of people in the world, wins the lottery? One. It has necessarily happened by the nature of the lottery.<p>We as a species have won this lottery, by the mere nature of our sentience. We should not think it mysterious or unusual in any way. However, we are lucky in the sense that we are here; we are special in that we can perceive and understand. As long as we understand the fact that there is no "should" in evolution, this is a perfectly fine thought. it just happened, and on this planet, it produced something able to understand itself. As Carl Sagan said, "We are a way for the cosmos to know itself." Certainly there is much metaphysical and philosophical consequence to our existence, but scientifically and probabilistically speaking, it makes perfect sense.<p>Consequently, I believe it may be much more difficult to reach true AI than some have postulated.";s:12:"story_author";s:7:"llambda";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4146912";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:13;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"171";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"jsdalton";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4660619";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:589:"I'll be the grouchy contrarian and observe that I frequently <i>don't</i> like the more highly voted submissions.<p>Seems the high point submissions are frequently pop science or culture articles (e.g., "Amateur astronomers discover a planet with four suns" or "A Very Unusual Camera That Emphasizes Time Over Space"), while the lower point submissions are articles I actually learn from (e.g. "Exploring the Virtual Database Engine inside SQLite" or "How to do a great product promo video for less than $200").<p>I get enough of the former on Reddit; I come to Hacker News for the latter.";s:12:"story_author";s:13:"martincmartin";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"22";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4659392";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:14;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"31";s:14:"comment_author";s:13:"richardofyork";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4435145";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2827:"I learned Backbone just about 3 months ago and the first project I built (still in developing) with it was a commercial eCommerce web application for a major client.

For example, the parser doesn&#x27;t know that functions may be returned from other functions:<p><pre><code>    $foo = function() { return function() { echo &quot;Hello;&quot; }; };
    $foo()();  &#x2F;&#x2F; Parse error
</code></pre>
Instead we have to perform some indirection like this:<p><pre><code>    call_user_func($foo());
</code></pre>
Or like this:<p><pre><code>    $bar = $foo();
    $bar();
</code></pre>
Likewise, the parser doesn&#x27;t realise that functions may be stored in objects:<p><pre><code>    $baz = new stdClass;
    $baz-&gt;quux = $foo();
    $baz-&gt;quux();  &#x2F;&#x2F; Error, no such method
</code></pre>
Again, we have to add an indirection:<p><pre><code>    call_user_func($baz-&gt;quux);
</code></pre>
Or<p><pre><code>    $foobar = $bar-&gt;quux;
    $foobar();
</code></pre>
Named functions can&#x27;t be closures, even though we can declare them anywhere, presumably for historical reasons, ie. this is a syntax error:<p><pre><code>    function foo($bar) {
      function baz() use ($bar) {
        echo $bar;
      }
    }
</code></pre>
Another example of making it unnecessarily hard to use functions is iterable objects, which can only be iterated via foreach loops (ie. there is no way to map, reduce or filter them).<p>Of course, I could also complain about no tail-call optimisation, functions not being curried, etc. but those aren&#x27;t PHP-specific since very few scripting languages seem to get them right for some reason :(";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"mariuz";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7251113";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:19;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"217";s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"jimrandomh";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"9726106";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1602:"The binary blob in question is hotword-x86-64.nexe with sha256sum 8530e7b11122c4bd7568856ac6e93f886bd34839bd91e79e28e8370ee8421d5a.<p>This is labelled as being a &quot;hotword&quot; implementation, ie, something that will monitor the microphone until someone says &quot;OK google&quot;, then start listening and transmitting the following words for a search.

They did the same thing to Android, twice: once with the &quot;Play Service Framework&quot;, which is a collection of APIs added to Android but theoretically independent of it, and again with Google Glass, which ran an entirely closed-source fork. In the case of Glass, I did some reverse-engineering and found that it would send all photos taken with Glass, and all text messages stored on a paired phone, and transmit them to Google, with no feasible way to stop it even with root.
