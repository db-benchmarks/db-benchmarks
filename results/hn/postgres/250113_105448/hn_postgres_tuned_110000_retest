The original plan was to learn web programming since I imagined web applications were both fun to develop and the best shot at a start-up. I took up Python and developed a simple file sharing application on Google App Engine (you can see it at myfilesinthesky.com but you don't lose anything if you don't).<p>Well, thinking about the interface and implementing the programming logic was actually fun. And it took 10% of the time. The other 90% was spent fighting with browsers' quirkiness and with Google App Engine (if I skipped GAE I would have fought with sys admin so not better I suppose). And that was teeth-cringing.<p>So I am not really sure web programming is that fun after all and the next step would be now to learn javascript to start doing browser-side wizardry which from what I'm reading around looks like as teeth cringing as it gets (ok, cobol programming is worse, I am sure).<p>And then I read Paul Graham's essays on tablets - paulgraham.com/tablets.html - and I am thinking now that ipad programming can be still promising business wise but much more fun since you have full control of the device and building native apps. No more need to get crazy with browser UI and sys admin stuff!<p>Before I spend the w.e. of the next six months learning C, obj-C and Cocoa, let me ask you, what would you advise to an aspiring programmer, learn web programming or dive into tablet programming?";}i:3;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"740";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"uptown";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"2937159";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"8";s:12:"comment_text";s:630:"I'd use Google+ more if the default view didn't show everybody's posts.

A loooong time ago when I was still in engineering I worked for Big Corp, Inc. and they had a designation for master technical talent, I forget the name, so let&#x27;s just call them Jedi Masters.  It was a non-management path for those who didn&#x27;t want to go the management route but it recognized their value to the company.  If you reached this level you had no manager and had no assigned work but people from other projects could come to them for advice, help, consultation, etc. and they could choose what they wanted to work on.<p>Often the Jedi Masters were tapped to teach intro engineering course to new engineers on the specifics of the type of projects this company worked on, so this was a quasi-academic and quasi-consulting gig for the best of the best engineers.<p>As a fairly new engineer, I got assigned to a new group and invited to a meeting that could impact the system I was working on.  I show up and it is a meeting with an engineering partner (outside company) that was contesting some calcs regarding the pipe strength and mounting requirements for an installation (multi-billion dollar project). Their engineering team was insisting on assumptions that would have quadrupled the cost of a system that our group was responsible for, not to mention weeks or months of delays to recalc and redesign the system. Unbeknownst to me, this dispute had been at logger heads for months with no resolution.<p>One of the Jedi&#x27;s, let&#x27;s just call him Fred, taught me years before in the intro courses and I had remained in contact with him over time. Based on the courses Fred taught I thought he might have the expertise and interest in this area to take a look at this problem so I met with him and gave him the technical details.  He agreed to attend the next meeting and advise but he made me do all the calcs, presentation and etc. for the next meeting but all under his guidance.  So I go through my PPT presentation and at the end the other company&#x27;s engineers have all sorts of objections, disagreements, etc. So our Jedi steps in and starts fielding questions and asks them to justify their position. It turns out that their reference text they were using to justify their position was actually written by Fred! I can still hear the other engineer say, &quot;you mean you are Fred XYZ that wrote book ABC&quot; with awe and respect in his voice. It turns out they were missing some important exceptions and qualifications later in the book that Fred cited and the meeting and conflict was resolved.<p>So the moral of the story is to always have a Jedi in your corner? No.<p>The moral of the story is that engineers and problem solvers (and I assume coders) have different motivation than the &quot;success&quot; of big, showy career managing a lot of people. We (technical people) love to solve problems and management is projecting their values onto technical people when they offer them management positions as &quot;promotions&quot;.";s:12:"story_author";s:8:"koopajah";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"25";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"8644175";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:3;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"49";s:14:"comment_author";s:5:"__abc";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"7738867";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"31";s:12:"comment_text";s:38:"back button behavior is atrocious ....";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"jlongster";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"34";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7738194";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:4;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"68";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"dbaupp";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4829025";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"2";s:12:"comment_text";s:555:"Another article with slightly more background on the ABC problem itself (and possibly slightly less sensationalist). <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/proof-claimed-for-deep-connection-between-primes-1.11378" rel="nofollow">http://www.nature.com/news/proof-claimed-for-deep-connection...</a><p>And the MathOverflow discussion referenced: <a href="http://mathoverflow.net/questions/106560/what-is-the-underlying-vision-that-mochizuki-pursued-when-trying-to-prove-the-abc" rel="nofollow">http://mathoverflow.net/questions/106560/what-is-the-underly...</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:2:"ot";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4828724";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:5;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"49";s:14:"comment_author";s:5:"__abc";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4845925";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"26";s:12:"comment_text";s:25:"I love me some Bootstrap!";s:12:"story_author";s:14:"michaelbuckbee";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"27";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4843593";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:6;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"17";s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"nathannecro";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"8408494";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2138:"Please HN, there are a few comments in this thread talking about &quot;taking action&quot; if you happen to be a bystander during an emergency.<p>Let me implore you. If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment.

in the code. Use simple names.<p>- Protect your interfaces. By this I mean, use a central place like a wiki to document your interfaces, so all involved parties may agree upon. Write unit-tests for interfaces. Use libraries like mockito and hamcrest that make it a breeze.(You would lock your home every time you go out, don&#x27;t you?)<p>- I mentioned this in the previous bullet, but write tests. Write lots of them, write tests that document any tricky, magical behavior.
Cover all the cases(A boat with one hole is bad as one with two holes). Cover all the invariants, any thing that you notice but didn&#x27;t mention in the source code. Write tests for the bugs you just fixed.<p>- If you are developing in Java, please use an IDE. I use Intellij, but Eclipse is good too. It makes refactoring code much easier.
Rename fields, pull classes up the hierarchy, create abstract classes, create getters and setters automatically with refactoring tools. I am not against emacs or vi, but it is hard to manage Java&#x27;s sprawl with them.<p>One of the best programmers I know writes code like it has been generated with a program.

The nature of capitalism is such that taking risk is the only path forward, regardless of how many failures it results in.<p>As the commenters above have noted, very few become billionaires by working 9 to 5 for someone else.

You shouldn't underestimate how many smart people there are working on world changing initiates, even in places like university labs.  Unfortunately world-changing research doesn't pay well.  Elon Musk on the other hand is a great example of hacking the system - making money the capitalist way, and then fund initiatives you want to be remembered for.

I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for "bling" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate. I offered email service, networked with other hip hop sites, and made about $100k from adsense before I was graciously C&#38;D'd and handed the name over.<p>Most recently I cofounded a project that was covered on the sites of TIME, CBS, Business Insider, Gawker, and pending an ABC News article.

I do interviews at a large Internet company, and one of my goals--one of the goals that I've been trained to seek--is to ensure that the candidate, no matter how bad, walks away from the interview feeling good about himself/herself and the company.  If you're doing really poorly in an interview, I'll toss you some easier questions than I normally give, because I have all the information I need, and I don't want you to have a negative experience with my company.  You may have felt good about the phone screens, but the most likely explanation for the two companies that didn't bring you onsite is that you didn't actually do well enough to justify additional interviews.  These people <i>want</i> to hire someone, and if you were someone they wanted to hire, they certainly <i>would</i> have continued to interview you.<p>I think your experiment was less valid than you think it was because you're less competent than you think you are.<p>EDIT: I should add that whatever the case, whether I'm right or wrong about you, the best response to the situation you're in is to seek to improve yourself, not to embark on a quixotic venture to change others.

A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc".

We're a long way away from a real cure, but survival rates have never been higher.<p>- Incredible advances in arthroscopic &#38; noninvasive/outpatient surgery &#38; procedures: In 2004-ish I blew out the "terrible triad" of knee ligaments; my surgery scars are just little dots. My brother had similar surgery just about 6-8 years prior to that, and he bears the ugly long scar over his kneecap.<p>That's just gleaned from one decade-end retrospective article, and is just focused on medical advances.<p>But also, stop and think back to the internet in 2000 versus where we are now.

Really. I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on.

My personal view is that I think by the time you bring someone in for an interview, you should already know that they can code, whether that&#x27;s through code samples they provide or through Github accounts or whatever.<p><i></i>TL;DR; Don&#x27;t waste your applicants time or your own<i></i><p>## The Interview
Interviewing should have two parts, imo:<p>* Confirming that I actually wrote the code I sent you and know what it means<p>* Confirming that you want to sit next to me for the next six months<p>I can tell you right now that if I take time off my current job to go sit in your office for an interview and you ask me basic questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; or &quot;What&#x27;s the difference between a POST and a GET request?&quot;, I&#x27;m going to thank you for your time and walk right out.<p>Why? Because my Github profile, which is featured prominently on my resume, contains examples of both. Half my projects are MVC projects, and many of them use 3rd party APIs (or are even APIs themselves!). The fact that you&#x27;re asking me basic definitions means you didn&#x27;t even pay attention to the stuff I sent you, so you&#x27;re wasting my time and yours. You could have already figured this out ahead of time. Instead, you asked me to take time out of my day (probably during work hours) to ask questions whose answers I&#x27;ve already provided.<p>(Please note that this only really goes for non-entry-level positions. For entry-level applicants, such as kids fresh out of college, you may not have very many code samples to work with. That&#x27;s fine. In that case, send some problems for them to work on at home. Hopefully, these are dumbed-down but real-world problems your company has faced in the past.)<p>## Phone Screen (aka verifying authenticity)<p>The first thing you should do is take a gander at my Github profile or my code samples. Then you call me up at a prearranged time and ask me questions about that code. Make me prove that I wrote what I said I wrote.<p>* I noticed you made this combat simulator (www.bitfalls.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;autofight-php-job-interview-task-part-1.html). Walk me through your thought process.<p>* Your code appears to be a custom MVC. Why did you choose to go with a custom one versus say, CodeIgniter or Symfony?<p>* This project is an API for Nerd Nite scheduling. First of all, what&#x27;s Nerd Nite and why did you make an API for it? Second, explain how you scraped the data, organized it, and output the results.<p>The above three questions will give you way more insight into my programming style and thought process than &quot;What is an MVC?&quot;. Please. Don&#x27;t waste my time. As a senior engineer with 7+ years in the field, I shouldn&#x27;t need to prove the equivalent of my ABCs to you. It should be understood.<p>I personally would also skip the whole &quot;live coding&quot; thing via Stypi or whatever. Waste of time, imo. You&#x27;ve already got code samples and you can ask me as many questions as you want about it. I shouldn&#x27;t need to write code in front of you to establish my credentials.<p>## What about people who lie?<p>There are people who lie about their resume and their qualifications, but that&#x27;s exactly why you should tailor your questions to fit the code samples provided. If I don&#x27;t get excited about that code and I can&#x27;t eloquently explain why I did what I did or how it works, then maybe I didn&#x27;t write it after all. It also gives you an insight as to my personality: I clearly took time out of my day to write this code. Why? What prompted me to write an API for Nerd Nite schedules?<p>The answers to those questions should give you an idea of whether I can actually program or not. Questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; can be looked up in a dictionary. Explaining code samples is much more difficult.<p>## What next?<p>Once you&#x27;ve established that I wrote the code I said I wrote, then Step 1 of The Interviewing process is mostly done. Now you bring me into the office to determine Step 2 -- am I someone you want sitting next to you for 8+ hours a day for the next six months? Do I fit in with company culture?<p>You could give me a problem to solve on the spot, but hopefully it&#x27;s more of a higher level thing rather than a &quot;write code on a whiteboard&quot; thing. The reason I say this is because at this point you should already have seen my code. You should know by now that I can build a class. The question you need to answer now is: given an arbitrary problem, can I solve it or at least come up with a reasonable thought process?<p>Bonus points if it&#x27;s relevant to the job. (i.e., if your job never requires you to write binary trees from scratch, don&#x27;t ask the applicant to do so.)<p>## Finally<p>Between the phone screen (technical) and in-person interview (personal), you should have a good idea of whether you want me on your team or not.<p>Occasionally for small teams, you may decide that you need to know something about time, creativity, independence, and other similar qualities that you can&#x27;t really get from code samples. If this is the case, then I suggest doing the contract thing, where you give them an assignment on contract. Once the assignment is finished, you hire them or pay them for the work completed (or hopefully both).<p>I really, really, really despise whiteboard coding. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s indicative of anything, and I think you will find a lot of false negatives (i.e., rule out good candidates) using the whiteboard method.<p>A few other thoughts:<p>* I should meet my potential future boss at the in-person interview<p>* I should meet at least one of my potential future coworkers<p>* Be respectful of my time. Most interviews take place during work hours, so I&#x27;ve taken time off work -- and probably lied to my boss about where I&#x27;m going! -- to meet with you. The least you can do is not waste my time.<p>* Be familiar with my resume and code samples. I took the time to write them, you should take the time to read them. It will answer way more questions about my abilities than a 20 minute quiz on technical terms will.<p>The more informal the in-person interview is, the better. The technical qualifications should already be accepted by the time I walk in the door. At this point, it&#x27;s a two way street as we figure out whether we want to work together. I&#x27;m interviewing you just as much as you are interviewing me.<p>(Note: These are just my opinions about how I interview others. It hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. On the other hand, almost every job I&#x27;ve ever interviewed for has completely wasted my time on that front.)";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"gameguy43";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"26";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"6559404";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:12;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"17";s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"nathannecro";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"8408494";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2138:"Please HN, there are a few comments in this thread talking about &quot;taking action&quot; if you happen to be a bystander during an emergency.<p>Let me implore you. If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment. Some of that equipment is located onboard a fire truck or an ambulance. Most of that equipment is usually found inside the operating room of your local hospital.

Then there's this guy:<p>&#62; The congressional responses were, Thank you for your letter, and thank you for your interest. And, Well look into this, basically.<p>&#62; I also wrote letters to just about every television journalist, and network journalist that I could get my hands on. Sent as e-mail with attachments and never received any response. [I wrote to] CNN and Fox News. ABC News, NBC News, CBS. My daughter was working at that time with one of the network affiliates in Phoenix, and she knew how upset I was about this whole thing. So she put me in contact with their consumer reporter, who does the consumer complaints and that sort of thing. He came out to my house and interviewed me for about 45 minutes. And I gave him documentation, and tried to as best I could to explain the situation to someone that was basically ignorant of the mortgage industry. Never heard another word. <p>&#62; During the mortgage meltdown, [Fox News host] Bill OReilly was having a temper tantrum on his show where he was going off about, Why didnt I hear about this? Why didnt somebody tell me about all this that was going on? And I almost threw my shoe through the television set. Ask my wife  I was screaming and yelling, I did try to let you know.

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5834687";s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for "bling" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate. I offered email service, networked with other hip hop sites, and made about $100k from adsense before I was graciously C&#38;D'd and handed the name over.<p>Most recently I cofounded a project that was covered on the sites of TIME, CBS, Business Insider, Gawker, and pending an ABC News article.

Read CS theory books, create and modify open source projects, solve fun programming puzzles: sharpen your skills and--no matter what your level of competency--your prospects will improve.<p>[0] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"up_and_up";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"61";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3351699";s:10:"story_text";s:4263:"TL;DR version: When developer talent sends you an email, you fail to reply!!!<p>==========<p>Full Version:<p>To all the startups and companies whining about lack of developer talent, I call your bluff.<p>I ran a little experiment over the last 60 days. I sent emails to ~50 different companies (some well-known, others unknown) that were looking for "Sr. Developers", particularly Ruby devs, as found on the major developer job sites (stackoverflow, Dice, Indeed, 37signals etc). I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting. I also picked companies that most closely matched my skillset. In my email I introduced myself and included my resume. Here is how I am represented in the email (paraphrased from actual text, ):<p>Given: X &#62; 7 &#38; Y &#62; 4,<p>"Sr. Level Developer, with X years exp. Y years of prof exp with Ruby. Main expertise is in Ruby, API's, MySQL and a bunch of other stuff. Previously worked for 'ABC' startup ($X Millions angel backed) for two years and helped build out the entire app/platform etc. Later served as CTO for several side projects. I attended Top Tier University , ...  blah blah blah"<p>More stats:<p>Salary expectations: $115K<p>Areas of interest: API's, Analytics, SaaS, Telephony, Machine learning ....<p>Ability to relocate: Open to idea, can't right away<p>Telecommuter?: Pretty please<p>Snark level: Not nearly as high as this post ;)<p>Likeability: Very high<p>So out of ~50 companies that I tried contacting what was the result?<p>10/50 - sent me a reply email of some sort (confirmation, autoreply, whatever)<p>7/50 - tried to setup a phone screen<p>5/50 - actually completed the phone screen (with all phones screens going very well, I might add)<p>3/50 - tried to setup a technical interview<p>0/50 - actually completed a technical interview<p>0/50 - made offer!<p>From my 60 day simple experiment, I argue......<p>The top 5 reasons you are (probably) not hiring:<p>1. You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc". If you think of "Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting";}i:7;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"gkefalas";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1038662";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1830:"In terms of medical advances, there may not have been any major blockbuster disease cures found, but there were several very important advances &#38; innovations.

We're a long way away from a real cure, but survival rates have never been higher.<p>- Incredible advances in arthroscopic &#38; noninvasive/outpatient surgery &#38; procedures: In 2004-ish I blew out the "terrible triad" of knee ligaments; my surgery scars are just little dots. My brother had similar surgery just about 6-8 years prior to that, and he bears the ugly long scar over his kneecap.<p>That's just gleaned from one decade-end retrospective article, and is just focused on medical advances.<p>But also, stop and think back to the internet in 2000 versus where we are now.

Really. I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on.

My personal view is that I think by the time you bring someone in for an interview, you should already know that they can code, whether that&#x27;s through code samples they provide or through Github accounts or whatever.<p><i></i>TL;DR; Don&#x27;t waste your applicants time or your own<i></i><p>## The Interview
Interviewing should have two parts, imo:<p>* Confirming that I actually wrote the code I sent you and know what it means<p>* Confirming that you want to sit next to me for the next six months<p>I can tell you right now that if I take time off my current job to go sit in your office for an interview and you ask me basic questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; or &quot;What&#x27;s the difference between a POST and a GET request?&quot;, I&#x27;m going to thank you for your time and walk right out.<p>Why? Because my Github profile, which is featured prominently on my resume, contains examples of both. Half my projects are MVC projects, and many of them use 3rd party APIs (or are even APIs themselves!). The fact that you&#x27;re asking me basic definitions means you didn&#x27;t even pay attention to the stuff I sent you, so you&#x27;re wasting my time and yours. You could have already figured this out ahead of time. Instead, you asked me to take time out of my day (probably during work hours) to ask questions whose answers I&#x27;ve already provided.<p>(Please note that this only really goes for non-entry-level positions. For entry-level applicants, such as kids fresh out of college, you may not have very many code samples to work with. That&#x27;s fine. In that case, send some problems for them to work on at home. Hopefully, these are dumbed-down but real-world problems your company has faced in the past.)<p>## Phone Screen (aka verifying authenticity)<p>The first thing you should do is take a gander at my Github profile or my code samples. Then you call me up at a prearranged time and ask me questions about that code. Make me prove that I wrote what I said I wrote.<p>* I noticed you made this combat simulator (www.bitfalls.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;autofight-php-job-interview-task-part-1.html). Walk me through your thought process.<p>* Your code appears to be a custom MVC. Why did you choose to go with a custom one versus say, CodeIgniter or Symfony?<p>* This project is an API for Nerd Nite scheduling. First of all, what&#x27;s Nerd Nite and why did you make an API for it? Second, explain how you scraped the data, organized it, and output the results.<p>The above three questions will give you way more insight into my programming style and thought process than &quot;What is an MVC?&quot;. Please. Don&#x27;t waste my time. As a senior engineer with 7+ years in the field, I shouldn&#x27;t need to prove the equivalent of my ABCs to you. It should be understood.<p>I personally would also skip the whole &quot;live coding&quot; thing via Stypi or whatever. Waste of time, imo. You&#x27;ve already got code samples and you can ask me as many questions as you want about it. I shouldn&#x27;t need to write code in front of you to establish my credentials.<p>## What about people who lie?<p>There are people who lie about their resume and their qualifications, but that&#x27;s exactly why you should tailor your questions to fit the code samples provided. If I don&#x27;t get excited about that code and I can&#x27;t eloquently explain why I did what I did or how it works, then maybe I didn&#x27;t write it after all. It also gives you an insight as to my personality: I clearly took time out of my day to write this code. Why? What prompted me to write an API for Nerd Nite schedules?<p>The answers to those questions should give you an idea of whether I can actually program or not. Questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; can be looked up in a dictionary. Explaining code samples is much more difficult.<p>## What next?<p>Once you&#x27;ve established that I wrote the code I said I wrote, then Step 1 of The Interviewing process is mostly done. Now you bring me into the office to determine Step 2 -- am I someone you want sitting next to you for 8+ hours a day for the next six months? Do I fit in with company culture?<p>You could give me a problem to solve on the spot, but hopefully it&#x27;s more of a higher level thing rather than a &quot;write code on a whiteboard&quot; thing. The reason I say this is because at this point you should already have seen my code. You should know by now that I can build a class. The question you need to answer now is: given an arbitrary problem, can I solve it or at least come up with a reasonable thought process?<p>Bonus points if it&#x27;s relevant to the job. (i.e., if your job never requires you to write binary trees from scratch, don&#x27;t ask the applicant to do so.)<p>## Finally<p>Between the phone screen (technical) and in-person interview (personal), you should have a good idea of whether you want me on your team or not.<p>Occasionally for small teams, you may decide that you need to know something about time, creativity, independence, and other similar qualities that you can&#x27;t really get from code samples. If this is the case, then I suggest doing the contract thing, where you give them an assignment on contract. Once the assignment is finished, you hire them or pay them for the work completed (or hopefully both).<p>I really, really, really despise whiteboard coding. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s indicative of anything, and I think you will find a lot of false negatives (i.e., rule out good candidates) using the whiteboard method.<p>A few other thoughts:<p>* I should meet my potential future boss at the in-person interview<p>* I should meet at least one of my potential future coworkers<p>* Be respectful of my time. Most interviews take place during work hours, so I&#x27;ve taken time off work -- and probably lied to my boss about where I&#x27;m going! -- to meet with you. The least you can do is not waste my time.<p>* Be familiar with my resume and code samples. I took the time to write them, you should take the time to read them. It will answer way more questions about my abilities than a 20 minute quiz on technical terms will.<p>The more informal the in-person interview is, the better. The technical qualifications should already be accepted by the time I walk in the door. At this point, it&#x27;s a two way street as we figure out whether we want to work together. I&#x27;m interviewing you just as much as you are interviewing me.<p>(Note: These are just my opinions about how I interview others. It hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. On the other hand, almost every job I&#x27;ve ever interviewed for has completely wasted my time on that front.)";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"gameguy43";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"26";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"6559404";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:12;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"17";s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"nathannecro";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"8408494";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2138:"Please HN, there are a few comments in this thread talking about &quot;taking action&quot; if you happen to be a bystander during an emergency.<p>Let me implore you. If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment. Some of that equipment is located onboard a fire truck or an ambulance. Most of that equipment is usually found inside the operating room of your local hospital.

For example, a good portion of the qualifying questions should focus on customer pain.<p>Does the prospect have the pain you solve?<p>Does the prospect already solve&#x2F;address the pain? If so, how? With whom? What is good about the current solution? What&#x27;s wrong with it?<p>Does the prospect have budget to solve the pain? How much? How is budget allocated and when? What is the budget process?<p>Who makes decisions about this pain? Who decides which solution to use?

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5834687";s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

It's a relatively shallow learning curve from Java to Python to JavaScript, but making the leap to a pure functional language is very difficult.  Path-dependence plays a huge part here.  This isn't just a matter of "people being afraid of what's different" as the article suggests; there are very rational reasons for a profit-seeking firm to exploit the fact that their developers (and those available to hire) are already relatively proficient at writing procedural code.<p>Another, more important reason, is that Haskell is too intellectually demanding for most industrial programmers.  I consider myself an enthusiast of functional programming, but achieving anything practical using purely functional code remains extremely difficult for me, even though I regularly dabble in it during my free time.  The Haskell IRC channel can be helpful, but it's very difficult to square "Haskell is easy enough for anyone to learn" with the inevitable "you are too stupid/impatient/incompetent to use Haskell effectively" taunts you're likely to hear, when you're asking for help to perform a simple task.  Many Haskell evangelists don't understand that most developers aren't nearly as smart or dedicated as they are.<p>I'd be curious to know where most Haskell users believe they lie on the distribution of programming ability.  I'd estimate most of them lie at the 99% percentile, and that any of them arguing otherwise are doing so out of modesty.  (Note that I'd include dedication and curiosity in with intelligence in this metric.)

Things at least seem to organize themselves somewhat better than they 'ought' to, just on the basis of blind-chance evolution and natural selection."</i><p>This is a common fallacy about evolution, and is explained beautifully by the anthropic principle, or in other words, the innate selection bias of our existence. We've self-selected for our own awareness of our circumstance and existence. Things are not organizing better than they "ought" to, they've just happened to organize to a sufficient point that we exist and perceive this process and say things about it like the above quote.<p>It is in the same way that someone who wins the lottery must think themselves exceedingly lucky that they, of all the millions of people participating, have won. They must think there is something mysterious about this, that things turned out somewhat better than they 'ought' to, just on the basis of blind chance.<p>Yet, what is the probability that some person, of the entire pool of people in the world, wins the lottery? One. It has necessarily happened by the nature of the lottery.<p>We as a species have won this lottery, by the mere nature of our sentience. We should not think it mysterious or unusual in any way. However, we are lucky in the sense that we are here; we are special in that we can perceive and understand. As long as we understand the fact that there is no "should" in evolution, this is a perfectly fine thought. it just happened, and on this planet, it produced something able to understand itself. As Carl Sagan said, "We are a way for the cosmos to know itself." Certainly there is much metaphysical and philosophical consequence to our existence, but scientifically and probabilistically speaking, it makes perfect sense.<p>Consequently, I believe it may be much more difficult to reach true AI than some have postulated.";s:12:"story_author";s:7:"llambda";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4146912";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:13;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"782";s:14:"comment_author";s:4:"dmix";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"8049032";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:282:"Here is a Reddit comment breaking down the proposal:<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/2aycxs/hi_this_is_ben_lawsky_at_nydfs_here_are_the/cizyqyz" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.reddit.com&#x2F;r&#x2F;Bitcoin&#x2F;comments&#x2F;2aycxs&#x2F;hi_this_is_b...</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:7:"mdelias";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"13";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"8048229";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:14;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"171";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"jsdalton";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4660619";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:589:"I'll be the grouchy contrarian and observe that I frequently <i>don't</i> like the more highly voted submissions.<p>Seems the high point submissions are frequently pop science or culture articles (e.g., "Amateur astronomers discover a planet with four suns" or "A Very Unusual Camera That Emphasizes Time Over Space"), while the lower point submissions are articles I actually learn from (e.g. "Exploring the Virtual Database Engine inside SQLite" or "How to do a great product promo video for less than $200").<p>I get enough of the former on Reddit; I come to Hacker News for the latter.";s:12:"story_author";s:13:"martincmartin";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"22";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4659392";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:15;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"31";s:14:"comment_author";s:13:"richardofyork";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4435145";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2827:"I learned Backbone just about 3 months ago and the first project I built (still in developing) with it was a commercial eCommerce web application for a major client.
