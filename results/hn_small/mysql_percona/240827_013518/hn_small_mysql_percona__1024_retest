However, I don't think Google buying T-Mobile would work out so well.<p>T-Mobile has no low-frequency spectrum.  Lower frequency spectrum allows signals to travel further (in real-world conditions) and offers better in-building coverage.  AT&#38;T and Verizon have most of the sub-1GHz spectrum in many markets with Sprint trying to re-farm the ~14MHz they acquired via Nextel.  A Google-owned T-Mobile wouldn't be pushing the envelope on coverage and that's something that the majority of Americans seem to find quite important (even if they don't venture out of their home location much).<p>T-Mobile is the furthest behind in the path to LTE.  Part of this is due to T-Mobile needing to move technologies to different radio bands.  T-Mobile (historically) ran GSM at 1900MHz and deployed UMTS at 1700MHz.  They are now trying to re-allocate that so that they can run UMTS at 1900MHz (a technology/frequency combination compatible with the iPhone) and LTE at 1700MHz (also compatible with the iPhone).  AT&#38;T, Verizon, and Sprint all have unused spectrum for their initial LTE deployments.  Even if Google were so inclined, it takes time to re-do a lot of these decisions and for customers to be appropriately equipped to move on to further plans.<p>Then the question comes up: how would Google improve T-Mobile or wireless in general?  T-Mobile's coverage likely wouldn't see dramatic expansion via Google ownership.  Google would probably push an aggressive LTE rollout, but certainly not faster than Verizon.  Unlike wired connections, wireless carriers have pushed out the latest technologies (or will within 5ish years of those technologies becoming available).  We know that we can get 100Mbps to the home over DOCSIS (cable) and ADSL in many countries is much more advanced.  Wireless isn't.  In fact, LTE is probably more advanced in the US than anywhere else (due mostly to Verizon, but others are similarly pushing).  Google couldn't really offer greater than LTE speed.  Google would probably want to offer an unlimited connection.  That would be quite welcome, but I wonder if they might bump up against capacity and capital constraints on this one.  If Google Mobile became as popular as AT&#38;T or Verizon, that Google Mobile would have considerably less spectrum (as T-Mobile has considerably less).  One can improve capacity by adding cell sites, but many jurisdictions make that very difficult to accomplish.  If it's less popular, are the revenues there to invest so much in the network?<p>In terms of financials, Sprint has been losing money for 7 years (expecting to start turning a profit in 2014) and T-Mobile seems to be going the red-ink route as well.  We coalesced (as a society) around two carriers and that's unfortunate.  Google doesn't just take on projects and subsidize them forever.  In fact, they do cancel many things.  I don't think we would expect Google to spend excessively on subsidizing wireless for consumers.<p>Speaking of finances, T-Mobile would probably want a price above $30B.  AT&#38;T offered $39B and T-Mobile has more assets today (in the form of wireless spectrum) due to AT&#38;T's breakup fee.  That's a lot of money to put toward this project.  I think a lot of us would like better competition in wireless and for wireless to be better in general.  However, without some sort of plan for what Google could bring (beyond an all-Android phone lineup of Google-approved devices), it doesn't seem (to me) that it would create something great.  It would greatly eclipse Google's next largest purchase (Motorola Mobility).  With Motorola, Google was getting an Android manufacturer and a patent portfolio.  It was strategic and Google clearly has ideas about how handsets should be made.  Do they have similar ideas on how a carrier should be run?<p>Finally, the thesis behind the article is that Google wants to push Android forward.  However, I question that.  Sure, Google came out with the Nexus 4 at $300, but it doesn't seem like they're pushing too hard to make sure supplies are available.  In some ways, it feels like they're trying to egg the industry along, but don't want to do it themselves.  In a lot of ways, it's more fun being the person outside the tent yelling at the people inside it.  If you can produce a proof of concept about how you can do better than them (without having to bring it to the same scale), all the better.<p>That isn't a criticism of Google or anyone in general.  We need people like that.  It's merely to point out that something like Google Fiber (or possibly the Nexus 4) isn't the same as becoming a utility company.  Google was offered rates below what the cities charge competitors (telco and cable companies) for using utility poles.  Google didn't have to spend time and money on things like getting resistant cities to allow them in or deal with onerous requirements - Google's proposition was "we'll pick whoever bends over backward the most for us".  Again, that isn't a criticism of Google, but merely to point out that many cities and towns in my area denied Verizon the right to install FiOS for reasons like not including enough public interest programming on their cable lineup.  Heck, in the cities that have Google Fiber, Google didn't even have to commit to serving the whole city.  Similarly, and this might be proven wrong in the coming months, the Nexus 4 might not be something Google intends to be mass-market, but more of an at-cost proof-of-concept.  We'll see if it becomes generally available selling millions in the coming months.  We'll also see if LTE becomes a part of the picture.<p>When purchasing a near-$40B wireless company, you have to really want to be in wireless.  You have to think you can make money out of it and you have to think you can do something better than the current management.  Maybe Google could do better - I'm hoping that Google Fiber becomes a runaway success and profit center for Google and expands across the country.  Maybe Google's prowess extends to utilities.  It would be awesome.  However, I think that Google doesn't want to test that out whole-hog.  I think they want to take baby steps.  They have Google Fiber for that purpose.  They had Google Nexus devices before buying Motorola.  Maybe a Google MVNO (virtual network operator running off of one of the national networks) first would let them test this.";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"esolyt";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4879524";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:3;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"296";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"amirmc";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"2737873";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:3333:"I have a better question.

I&#x27;ve been railing about this pretty much since G+ started (originally with nymwars) and Google just seems to continue not getting it.  Mega thanks to David for getting this on the queue and everyone who upvoted.  For something which was just a throwaway post (as I said:  I was looking for one of my own earlier instances and stumbled across a whole trove), this had legs.<p>The HN moral:  sometimes your best work is the stuff that takes little effort, thought it helps to hit the Zeitgeist wave just right.<p>I ... don&#x27;t <i>dislike</i> Google, though the company&#x27;s made itself vastly harder to like, and for me personally, its brand equity has been tremendously hurt by my experience to its corporate goals and motives surrounding G+, pretty much from the start.  My history with the company goes back further -- I was using its search during beta in 1998&#x2F;1999, and the reason was simple:  it made things easier for me, and performed useful tasks, far better than anyone else at the time.<p>For a long time I saw Google bashing as almost entirely a Microsoft phenomenon, but I&#x27;ve got to say that&#x27;s no longer the case.  I&#x27;m absolutely no friend of Redmond&#x27;s, and have watched events there over the past few months with no small amount of schadenfreude.  There&#x27;s no question that Microsoft continues to bash Google (sometimes effectively, often pretty cluelessly).  It&#x27;s very clear to me that there&#x27;s a pretty solid and consistent backlash not just from techies, but as the G+ search I ran made clear, from ordinary people sick of intrusive questions.<p>I could wax on about privacy, and people who could be endangered or put in harm&#x27;s way or find their lives ruined or what if Stalinist Nazi Cthulu buys Google... and all of that&#x27;s entirely valid, but it&#x27;s besides the point.  Even if none of that applies, and you prefer <i>not</i> to have your personal data aggregated, if you say &quot;no&quot;, the meaning is simple:  &quot;no&quot;.  Stop asking.  Don&#x27;t go ahead and do it anyway.  Don&#x27;t put buttons where they&#x27;re likely to get hit accidentally, or confusing dialogs, or interstitials, or anything else.<p>Because it&#x27;s about respect.<p>But even if none of the factors above apply, the simple fact that I&#x27;ve and many, many others have made amply clear that no, we don&#x27;t wish to provide this information, no, we don&#x27;t wish to link our various associated identities, and no, we don&#x27;t want to be part of your &quot;identity network&quot;, means that Google (and, to be fair, a great many other companies and entities) are going OUT OF THEIR WAY TO EXPLICITLY DISRESPECT THAT PREFERENCE.<p>And that Google, very, very clearly, no longer respects me, or any of its users, based on far too many of its actions.  Where Google used to make a decent coin offering incidental ads on top of a useful services, it&#x27;s ... lost its way.<p>The data aggregation is one part of it.  &quot;No&quot; means &quot;No&quot;.  It&#x27;s a really simple message.<p>Somewhat ironically, I&#x27;d recently kicked off a G+ Community (private and invite only, sorry, I&#x27;ve actually transferred ownership to others as well) to discuss an anti-harassment policy following a long and detailed discussion:<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/108316670838828910396/posts/9gMF3qyqpbK" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plus.google.com&#x2F;108316670838828910396&#x2F;posts&#x2F;9gMF3qyq...</a><p>Google&#x27;s own inability to play by similar rules is ... interesting.<p>I&#x27;d also been reviewing some older posts, mine and other people&#x27;s, as well as many of the YouTube top contributor responses (Reggie, Jonathan Paula, and others).  Three points that kept getting made again and again were:<p>1. Google&#x27;s interfaces make tons of work for users.  It&#x27;s sort of the anti-Perl:  they make easy things hard (and tedious), and hard things impossible.  Responding to YouTube comments, muting or blocking users, flagging spam, setting volume controls, managing Circles, checking on blocked &#x2F; muted users, and on and on.  In particular the fact that <i>to take care of a problem here and now</i> you&#x27;ve got to <i>go somewhere else within the site to deal with it.</i>  The lack of concurrent controls is ... maddening.<p>2. There was no direct control over things.  Google apparently are trying to handle everything &quot;behind the scenes&quot; through machine intelligence.  And far too often doing an absolutely miserable job of it, especially where some very basic controls (dismiss post, time-out a user, comment moderation tools for posts) would help tremendously.  I&#x27;ve seen some suggestions that earlier iterations (Wave or Buzz) are considered to have failed in part because their interfaces were too complex, but if anything G+ suffers from too <i>few</i> controls.  And one sign of an oversimplified interface is that people start devising conventions to get around limitations.  This happens on G+ in spades.<p>3. Noise controls.  People&#x27;s streams are absolutely out of control.  I&#x27;d noted starting in March or thereabouts that I was finding Notifications and Search far more useful than my Stream.  In a discussion of the +1 automatic share issue, Lauren Weinstein&#x27;s guests similarly noted that they were using their Streams less and less:<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/events/c0sddcekptbf047pb3if23rfvjc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plus.google.com&#x2F;events&#x2F;c0sddcekptbf047pb3if23rfvjc</a><p>In particular, Robert Scoble (the old noisemaker hisself) has ranted repeatedly and epicly on the lack of proper noise controls on G+, from pretty much day 1.  This is from about a year in, but few of the points have been addressed:<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/111091089527727420853/posts/9mA8XCdu3qA" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plus.google.com&#x2F;111091089527727420853&#x2F;posts&#x2F;9mA8XCdu...</a><p>When I go to a site such as Hacker News or Reddit, I typically <i>look at the front page first</i> to see what&#x27;s been selected.  Because, well, it&#x27;s been selected.  G+ Streams and Communities don&#x27;t do that.  I turn to them, if at all, <i>after</i> going through Notifications or explicitly searching for things.  I recently suggested G+ fix &quot;What&#x27;s Hot&quot; by simply renaming it &quot;What&#x27;s Rot&quot;.<p>Who really nailed it for me though was Homer Slated&#x27;s comment on this issue at G+ (NB: it&#x27;s a touch piquant):<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/102946757503830834230/posts/Mim3MwZTrXc" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plus.google.com&#x2F;102946757503830834230&#x2F;posts&#x2F;Mim3MwZT...</a><p>In a comment he writes, that when receiving a Notification from Google:<p><i>[W]hat Google is doing is, essentially, telling me that it&#x27;s found a word in the dictionary that I might be interested in, that it&#x27;s seven letters long and contains the letter &quot;g&quot;, but rather than just telling me what the word is, or even linking directly to it, it simply links me to a dictionary, then expects me to spend hours trawling through that dictionary just to finds that word....</i><p><i>It helps to understand that Google is not a search company, or a social networking outfit, or an email provider ... it&#x27;s an advertising company, and therefore everything it does is oriented toward the principle of &quot;promotion&quot;....</i><p><i>While I have no doubt that Google has highly sophisticated search algorithms working behind the scenes, the results that you and I are actually presented with, and the mechanisms for obtaining those results, are skewed toward &quot;buzz&quot;, not accuracy or relevance.</i><p><i>In other words, if Google were a news organisation, it wouldn&#x27;t be reporting the news, it would be fabricating it, then tailoring that work of fiction to appeal to (what it believes is) your &quot;general&quot; interests.</i><p><i>If there was a single word that could concisely sum up Google, it would be &quot;vague&quot;. Google is deliberately vague, it&#x27;s notifications are vague, the way it handles articles and comments is vague, its search results are vague ... and by no accident. Google is deliberately vague because it wants to steer you away from what&#x27;s actually relevant to you, and what actually interests you, to those things it wants you to become interested in.</i><p>In a G+ post I discussed lies.  The common one is the lie of commission:  I tell you something that&#x27;s not true, a fabrication.  Another, slightly more nuanced, is the lie of <i>omission</i> -- neglecting to inform you of a material fact.  You&#x27;ll find it especially referenced in business contracts, particularly real-estate and M&amp;A concerning adverse conditions.  A third type is what I&#x27;ve called a &quot;lie of diversion&quot;.  It&#x27;s generally not a truth or a non-truth itself, but its purpose is to <i>obscure</i> truth, meaning, and relevance.  It&#x27;s at the heart of much of what&#x27;s wrong (IMO) with &quot;viral media&quot; and messages -- little non-facts floating around in little non-informational nuggets, clogging up your cognitive circuits.  And processing all that non-information <i>takes a lot of effort</i>.<p><a href="https://plus.google.com/104092656004159577193/posts/5zrCkbzRqrB" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;plus.google.com&#x2F;104092656004159577193&#x2F;posts&#x2F;5zrCkbzR...</a><p>The biggest problem with G+ I was consistently running into was simply the non-relevance of what it was presenting me.  And that&#x27;s a change fundamentally due, I suspect, to its reliance on advertising and the culture this brings.<p>Google thought it could ride the advertising tiger when it opted to go that way early in its career. And for a time it did. But in a long and storied career of riding tigers, I&#x27;ve learned two things: ultimately the tiger is in control, and dismounting is the hardest part.<p>The lack of respect is why I feel that Google&#x27;s corporate culture is fundamentally broken. Whether it&#x27;s a rotten core or a rotten head I don&#x27;t know. I absolutely don&#x27;t question that there are some very well-meaning people working for Google, especially within the engineering staff. Possibly high on the org chart. But enough people, in enough positions of power, and I strongly suspect Larry Page, Eric Schmidt, and Vic Gundotra as being part of that group, either don&#x27;t get it, are actively pursuing personal data aggregation, or, and this actually frightens me more: have been persuaded that it&#x27;s in their best interest to follow this path via a deal they cannot refuse.<p>Frankly, none of those possibilities does much to give me any level of faith in the company. Or in any centrally-organized personal data-gathering effort.";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"davidgerard";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"47";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"6745525";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:7;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"11";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"adad95";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"9162511";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"52";s:12:"comment_text";s:3138:"Required:

Let me instead back-up one of his points with more evidence:<p>First off: I am a huge Google fanboy, I'm a full-time Android developer and Google scholarships even helped pay for my college. It seems that every time I say anything bad about Google anywhere on the Internet people call me an Apple fanboy so I just wanted to state that.<p>&#62; Google's Weird Attempt At Social<p>Let's take a look at how many different ways I can do a simple chat with my friends using Google products on my Android Ice Cream Sandwich device.<p>Google Voice - My main way of text messaging.<p>Google Talk - My main way IM client<p>Google+ Messaging (Formerly known as Huddle) - A mobile only way to communicate with my G+ friends.<p>Here's where it gets weird:<p>Google Voice - Anything I can is instantly synched with the Google Voice app on my iPad, Google Voice on my browser, the third party Google Voice app I use on my computer and my phone.<p>Google Talk - Anything I do is synched up to Google Talk on my computer or any place I'm logged in, which also means all my Google Talk conversation logs can be found using the GMail app on my phone.<p>Google+ Messaging - Boom. Say something to any of my friends on here, unable to look back at the messages unless I get on my phone again. "Oh, where did Kyle say we're meeting up tonight? I should print directions" Oh, my phone's out of battery and charging. Well, there goes that plan.<p>The craziest thing is that if I want to do Google+ Hangout (worst name I've ever heard for any product) I have to either use the website or the Google+ Messaging app. That's right, if I want to do a Hangout on my phone (a feature they're really pushing with their ICS video ads) I have to do it in a self-contained application that will not reflect any changes on the website. How does this make any sense?<p>It's even worse when you think about it. If I want to do a video chat with my friends using ONLY Google products I actually have two different choices! I can either Google+ Hangout with them using the Messenger application on my phone (try to comprehend that sentence, seriously.) or I can use Google Talk's video chatting (the feature they were pushing very hard with Honeycomb). Why couldn't they just integrate group messaging and video chatting right into Google Talk? I already have a fully functioning video chatting application on my phone that doesn't require people to be on a website or their phones to use it! I can use Google Talk's video chat to talk to anyone using Google Talk anywhere!<p>I know that Google's Weird Attempt At Social is due to buying so many different companies and not consolidating them, but it's not anything close to an ideal user experience.<p>Sidenote:

Because this is a paid Google advert.<p>&gt; But this spring, Google introduced a product called Sustained Use Discounts, and this made things much simpler.<p>I&#x27;d argue that the sustained use model makes it harder to calculate your ultimate bill, not easier. It has the same issues Amazon&#x27;s now retired Light and Medium usage tiers had, how do you track if you&#x27;re at 25%, 50%, 75%, etc utilisation? Keeping track of that is annoying and harder than you&#x27;d think in a real production environment with dynamic instances responding to load.<p>Amazon&#x27;s new pricing model actually just scrapped something akin to sustained use billing because it was unpopular. You wouldn&#x27;t know that reading the article.<p>&gt; Maybe they didnt want to draw attention to whats obviously a reaction to Google<p>Maybe it was a reaction to customer feedback? I see no evidence that Google caused this change, and the fact that Amazon moved AWAY from Google&#x27;s model is very telling. Light and medium utilisation RI are effectively Google&#x27;s model, they just do it dynamically. Amazon hasn&#x27;t added that or indicated that they will.<p>Do these people even understand Amazon&#x27;s RI pricing structure, or Google&#x27;s sustained usage, or anything at all?<p>&gt; Byrne says that until Amazon changed its pricing, his company was toying with the idea of switching to Google, a move that would have saved Copper.io hundreds of thousands of dollarsuntil Monday, at least.<p>That literally makes zero sense. Heavy utilisation RIs have been available since forever, and are extremely price competitive with every other major competitor in the cloud infrastructure space (namely Google, and Azure).<p>If it would have saved you &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; legitimately then you are mismanaging your account heavily.<p>&gt; When I saw the Amazon announcement, I said: Great. We dont have to consider moving.&#x27;<p>Because, why? I don&#x27;t understand what it is they think Amazon changed. Because that statement makes no sense. If you were mismanaging your account before, you&#x27;d still be mismanaging it now. Amazon moving payments will save you a little money (due to the interest on that money sitting in your accounts) but nothing like what is described here.<p>&gt; When Google first got into the cloud business back in 2008, the company bet that people would want to run cloud applications on its infrastructure in highly specialized ways and not mess around with operating systems and virtual machines. That proved to be a bad bet.<p>That is an under-statement. Google thought that people wanted to be locked into their cloud APIs and initially at least have to completely re-write all of their software for Google&#x27;s app engine. It was supremely arrogant on Google&#x27;s part.<p>App engine now supports more standardised APIs and databases, but it remains more expensive to do than it should be. Azure&#x27;s &quot;web-sites&quot; product is what Google App Engine should have been when it first got released, and even today I find &quot;web-sites&quot; more compelling as a bottled solution than Google App Engine (although VMs trump both).<p>&gt; And now the company is fast catching up.<p>Is that a fact? Because both Google and Azure topped $1B in 2013, and from what I&#x27;ve been seeing Azure, not Google, has been growing to compete with Amazon in 2014. Microsoft has been leveraging many pre-existing channels (education, MSDN, et al) to give out Azure trials and it seems to be working for them.<p>&gt; Byrne says that while Google doesnt offer the wide range of products, it beats out Amazon in many respects. Googles compute speed and network is faster than Amazons, he says. Theyre probably the only people where you can say that their infrastructure is really world-leading.<p>If you weren&#x27;t certain this was a paid product advert, now you should be.<p>Compute speed is relative to cost, and dollar per dollar that statement seems untrue. Network speed on Amazon and Google is great, Google might be better but I wouldn&#x27;t migrate to them because neither Amazon or Azure have let me down in that department.";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"kevbin";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"13";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"8699242";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:13;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"114";s:14:"comment_author";s:9:"arturadib";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4533841";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"2";s:12:"comment_text";s:1776:"There must be something seriously deceptive about these stats.<p>To begin with, as experienced by others here, my Google+ is extremely quiet.

I care a lot about this case (doing interoperable development), and there is some nuance to what is going on that I don&#x27;t think many of the people commenting on this matter in the general developer public appreciate.<p>To fail to summarize ;P, this nuance stems from separating the question of whether Oracle&#x27;s APIs are copyrightable from whether Google can claim &quot;fair use&quot; in copying them for their purposes. Much like with trademarks (where people get really uptight that someone &quot;trademarked a word&quot;, ignoring context restrictions), I think people lose these nuances while talking about situations like this, and presume that if something is protected in some way then it is an ironclad protection that applies even in ludicrous circumstances.<p>Keeping this difference in mind, if the court said &quot;APIs are copyrightable, but what Google did was a clear example of fair use: creating interoperable implementations is allowed&quot;, some people might still be angry, but I think many fewer people would be bothered: it changes what the opinion means. And, in fact, this is closer to what this opinion is saying than many people seem to be reading from it: they talk a lot about whether what Google is doing might be fair use, but they essentially punt that call back to the lower court.<p>&gt; Because the jury deadlocked on fair use, we remand for further consideration of Googles fair use defense in light of this decision.<p>We then have to ask &quot;what happened&quot; with this fair use argument, as we would <i>hope</i> that in the situation that APIs are copyrightable that interoperating with those APIs would be considered fair use: &quot;something went wrong here&quot;. I think we can actually see some disappointing mistakes in Google&#x27;s argument from reading this opinion: even though it wasn&#x27;t trying to decide this matter directly, it talks a lot about fair use and models of interoperability. It frankly seems like Google just did a really really bad job of arguing the case :(.<p>If we go back to the beginning of this, most of Sun&#x27;s core arguments about Java surround the idea that code written against Java should run on anything claiming to support Java. Microsoft was really excited about Java, but because they wanted to add a few extra features--some classes that would exist for UI purposes on their implementation of Java but on no other--the Internet has ever since considered them horribly evil people and were happy when Sun won in court against them (which is why Microsoft decided to build C#, btw).<p>Google seriously did not want to build something interoperable with Java under this definition: they have their own class libraries for handling large regions of the platform, including basic things absolutely any application would be using a lot of, such as UI and RPC. Given this, Google trying to claim &quot;we want to be interoperable with Java&quot; is horribly confusing. You find the opinion trying to understand Google&#x27;s position on interoperability and failing: it almost makes Google look like they are lying about &quot;interoperability&quot;.<p>&gt; Indeed, given the record evidence that Google designed Android so that it would <i>not</i> be compatible with the Java platform, or the JVM specifically, we find Google&#x27;s interoperability argument confusing. While Google repeatedly cites to the district court&#x27;s finding that Google had to copy the packages so that an app written in Java could run on Android, it cites to no evidence in the record that any such app exists and points to no Java apps that either pre-dated or post-dated Android that could run on the Android platform.<p>&gt; During oral argument, Google&#x27;s counsel stated that &quot;a program written in the Java language can run on Android if it&#x27;s only using packages within the 37. So if I&#x27;m a developer and I have written a program, I&#x27;ve written it in Java, I can stick an Android header on it and it will run in Android because it is using the identical names of the classes, methods, and packages.&quot; Counsel did not identify any programs that use only the 37 API packages at issue, however, and did not attest that any such program would be useful. Nor did Google cite to any record evidence to support this claim.<p>Now, I have certainly seen many Java libraries that manage to only use this subset of features; and to me, being able to use those libraries is an interesting aspect of &quot;interoperability&quot;. Sadly, however, Google&#x27;s lawyers seem to have not bothered making that argument: they were probably doing the important thing where they simplify the kinds of words and ideas they are using for the jury to quickly understand, but the difference between applications and libraries needs to not be understated and left to implicit context :(.<p>The result is that rather than seeing what Google was doing as building an interoperable implementation of an API, the panel sees Google as instead building their own <i>non</i>-interoperable platform that <i>happens to share striking similarities to Oracle&#x27;s Java</i>. They feel like Google is just copying a bunch of effort and work and even creative expression that Sun had put into Java in the construction of Google&#x27;s competing way of developing applications for the seemingly-purposely unrelated platform that they are using on Android.<p>&gt; The compatibility Google sought to foster was not with Oracle&#x27;s Java platform or with the JVM central to that platform. Instead, Google wanted to capitalize on the fact that software developers were already trained and experienced in using the Java API packages at issue. The district court agreed, finding that, as to the 37 Java API packages, &quot;Google believed Java application programmers would want to find the same 37 sets of functionalities in the new Android system callable by the same names as used in Java.&quot;<p>Let&#x27;s say that Microsoft&#x27;s C# happened to have a programming library that had large regions of API that were &quot;directly copied&quot; from the standard library of Java, even if there were no way to even attempt to run a Java class&#x2F;jar on the .NET Virtual Machine. While many people would still say &quot;that clearly should be allowed&quot;, I think that changes the character of the discussion quite a bit: I think many of the same people angry at Samsung about copying things off Apple would find themselves angry at Microsoft for copying things off Sun.<p>Again, I want to stress that I am not saying this should sit well with everyone: I can easily appreciate the arguments of people who feel that APIs should simply fundamentally not be subject to copyright. (That said, I can also appreciate the arguments of people who feel that software in general should not be subject to copyright, and I appreciate the arguments of people who believe that absolutely nothing should be subject to copyright as they think the idea of copyright is flawed. These are all somewhat reasonable positions to me.)<p>Instead, I point this stuff out as I think people are extrapolating too much from this decision and are taking it to mean things that it doesn&#x27;t: in particular, it doesn&#x27;t mean that you can&#x27;t build systems that interoperate with an API designed by another party. It is then unfortunate that people are extrapolating this decision all the way up to hyperbole like &quot;the PC revolution wouldn&#x27;t have happened under this ruling&quot;. It just doesn&#x27;t help when people make these kinds of grandiose statements: everything becomes emotional :&#x2F;.<p>Really, what we are looking at (and I think grellas is saying something similar, though from a different direction) is an opinion that leaves an area of law in a state where it is not entirely clear: that is a problem, as it leads to individuals having to make horrible and oft-flawed decisions as to whether specific actions they want to perform are or are not allowed. But this uncertainty is not the same as saying &quot;this is not allowed&quot;; and even if Google&#x27;s usage was not allowed, maybe a intended-to-be-fully-interoperable Java is.";s:12:"story_author";s:7:"dctoedt";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"42";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7721601";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:15;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"299";s:14:"comment_author";s:3:"nly";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"8694537";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"6";s:12:"comment_text";s:2419:"Here&#x27;s a list of all the companies registered in the UK with the string &#x27;Google&#x27; in them, that aren&#x27;t listed as &#x27;dissolved&#x27; (there are a lot of those), and aren&#x27;t obviously registered by morons[0][1][2][3][4][5][6][7][8][9] who think they can infringe on the trademark.<p><pre><code>    BR017040    GOOGLE COMMERCE LIMITED UK ESTABLISHMENT

This is even more apparent as Google are placing their Google Product Search within the results as well. Sure, you could add yourself to Google Product Search but thats not the point - Google <i>should</i> be adding ecommerce sites etc in their automatically to make it <i>a level playing field</i>. Sure, you can argue that it is hard to do and that might be the case but, there is proof out there in the marketplace to highlight that this is possible - look at what TheFind etc are doing in this space. Additionally, I think there is a lot more that can be done in the Shopping Search space as well as other areas of search which I will cover below.<p>Having covered those, I will also highlight another problem which is <i>hindering</i> Google = their search engine is based around the Pagerank algorithm which despite evolving is actually <i>hurting</i> Google in trying to solve the problem of SEO.<p>I believe this is the case because of PageRank and the general Google Search algorithms which are in place  their search at its core is based on 'citations' like those in academic papers etc (yes it has evolved over time) but it is still even loosely based and developed upon on this ranking system. Hence there is the problem of paid links - although you can report them [1] this reporting method actually isn't effective and doesn't work. Additionally, there are tons of ways to get links really easily which appear natural, wont appear overly seod and are <i>extremely</i> easy to get and game as well.<p>Google seems to be taking their search into the, Semantic &#38; Social Search approaches which they will probably solve some of these aspects but, everyone is working out (and many have already worked out) how to game social search although, it is a step in at least a decent direction.<p>Currently, Google just provides links and documents etc to the ones which it believes is the most useful based on their Pagerank/keyword approach and even if it can improve search to a much greater degree the issue is also related to Adsense/Adwords.<p>This is because; these two print money for Google. For instance, Adwords really is used for Google Search (yes it does feed into Adsense as well but Advertisers really want their ads on Google Search Results). The last statistic I heard about Google Search, is around 2007 when Google was making $0.12 on average per search  you could probably calculate easily how much Google is making now by looking at their income and dividing it by publicly available search numbers but, Im going to say its more than that because in 2004, they were making $0.09 per search. This is actually an issue for the user because, I believe Google really just want their ad results to be perfect  they dont really want you to have to click on the result because then Google isnt making any money  as long as their results are good enough so then theyre Ok with that If you dont believe me, take a look at [2] thats a whole lot of ads above the fold. Oh, and if you try and do that be prepared to be punished [3].<p>Now Adsense, sure it doesnt make that much of Googles income but it still is highly profitable  if it wasnt they wouldnt be doing it. If Google, really wants to fix search then they need to review every single Adsense site and I mean every single Adsense site since Google only reviews the site which you apply with. This leads of a huge problem as MFAs aka. Made For Adsense slip through the net afterwards and if you look at their sites, theyre generally have poor content etc and are optimised for the search engine and the user to leave either by clicking the back button.  Sure, Google will lose some Adsense income on their balance sheet but if they want to fix search this is also a good place to start.<p>Sure they're trying to solve this issue and get to grips with it but I don't think they will anywhere in the near future.  You can argue this fix they have announced will solve some SEO problems but, as I said in my opening sentence I believe this is the <i>wrong</i> approach and some of the above reasons highlight several issues already but there are tons more.  In fact, I actually hope you disagree with me because, not only do I value your opinion but am interested in the other aspects you may add to it.<p>[1] <a href="https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/paidlinks?pli=1" rel="nofollow">https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/paidlinks?pli=1</a><p>[2] <a href="http://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2012/01/6728099139_d5444820cf_z.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://searchengineland.com/figz/wp-content/seloads/2012/01/...</a><p>[3] <a href="http://searchengineland.com/too-many-ads-above-the-fold-now-penalized-by-googles-page-layout-algo-108613" rel="nofollow">http://searchengineland.com/too-many-ads-above-the-fold-now-...</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:7:"ilamont";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"32";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3717422";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:18;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"248";s:14:"comment_author";s:13:"cdvonstinkpot";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3778633";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"2";s:12:"comment_text";s:3408:"Clickable:<p><a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=sin%285.5x%29*cos%285*y%29%2Bx*x%2B1&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=sin%285.5x%29*cos%285*...</a><p><a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;q=1%2F%20sin%20abs%20x%20%2Bx%20-cos%20abs%20y%20%2By" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted.google.com/search?hl=en&#38;q=1%2F%20sin%2...</a><p><a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=sqrt%28x*x%2By*y%29%2B3*cos%28sqrt%28x*x%2By*y%29%29%2B5&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=sqrt%28x*x%2By*y%29%2B...</a><p><a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=5000-140*%28x*x%2By*y%29%2B%28x*x%2By*y%29^2&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=5000-140*%28x*x%2By*y%...</a><p><a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=sin%28x^2%2By^2%29%2F%28abs%28x*y%29%2B1%29+from+-2.5+to+2.5&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=sin%28x^2%2By^2%29%2F%...</a><p><a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=tanh%28y%28y^4%2B5x^4-10%28x^2%29%28y^2%29%29%2F%28x^2%2By^2%29^4%29&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=tanh%28y%28y^4%2B5x^4-...</a><p><a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=%28x^2%2B%28%283+y%29%2F2-%28x^2%2Babs%28x%29-6%29%2F%28x^2%2Babs%28x%29%2B2%29%29^2%29-36&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=%28x^2%2B%28%283+y%29%...</a><p><a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=sin%285.5x%29*cos%285*y%29%2Bx*x%2B1+x+is+from+-1+to+1%2C+y+is+from+-1+to+1%2C+z+is+from+0.1+to+2.8&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=sin%285.5x%29*cos%285*...</a><p><a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=100-3%2F%28sqrt%28x^2%2By^2%29%29%2Bsin%28sqrt%28x^2%2By^2%29%29%2C+x+is+from+-10+to+10%2C+y+is+from+-10+to+10%2C+z+is+from+85+to+101&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=100-3%2F%28sqrt%28x^2%...</a><p><a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=5+%2B+%28-sqrt%281-x^2-%28y-abs%28x%29%29^2%29%29*cos%2830*%28%281-x^2-%28y-abs%28x%29%29^2%29%29%29%2C+x+is+from+-1+to+1%2C+y+is+from+-1+to+1.5%2C+z+is+from+1+to+6&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=5+%2B+%28-sqrt%281-x^2...</a><p><a href="https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=100-3%2F%28sqrt%28x^2%2By^2%29%29%2Bsin%28sqrt%28x^2%2By^2%29%29%2Bsqrt%28200-%28x^2%2By^2%29%2B10*sin%28x%29%2B10sin%28y%29%29%2F1000%2C+x+is+from+-15+to+15%2C+y+is+from+-15+to+15%2C+z+is+from+90+to+101&#38;ie=utf-8&#38;oe=utf-8&#38;aq=t&#38;rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&#38;client=firefox-a" rel="nofollow">https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=100-3%2F%28sqrt%28x^2%...</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"ing33k";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"40";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3777505";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:19;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"253";s:14:"comment_author";s:7:"pitdesi";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3102800";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"39";s:12:"comment_text";s:26534:"It now 404's so I've posted it here:<p>Stevey's Google Platforms Rant<p>I was at Amazon for about six and a half years, and now I've been at Google for that long. One thing that struck me immediately about the two companies -- an impression that has been reinforced almost daily -- is that Amazon does everything wrong, and Google does everything right. Sure, it's a sweeping generalization, but a surprisingly accurate one. It's pretty crazy. There are probably a hundred or even two hundred different ways you can compare the two companies, and Google is superior in all but three of them, if I recall correctly. I actually did a spreadsheet at one point but Legal wouldn't let me show it to anyone, even though recruiting loved it.<p>I mean, just to give you a very brief taste: Amazon's recruiting process is fundamentally flawed by having teams hire for themselves, so their hiring bar is incredibly inconsistent across teams, despite various efforts they've made to level it out. And their operations are a mess; they don't really have SREs and they make engineers pretty much do everything, which leaves almost no time for coding - though again this varies by group, so it's luck of the draw. They don't give a single shit about charity or helping the needy or community contributions or anything like that. Never comes up there, except maybe to laugh about it. Their facilities are dirt-smeared cube farms without a dime spent on decor or common meeting areas. Their pay and benefits suck, although much less so lately due to local competition from Google and Facebook. But they don't have any of our perks or extras -- they just try to match the offer-letter numbers, and that's the end of it. Their code base is a disaster, with no engineering standards whatsoever except what individual teams choose to put in place.<p>To be fair, they do have a nice versioned-library system that we really ought to emulate, and a nice publish-subscribe system that we also have no equivalent for. But for the most part they just have a bunch of crappy tools that read and write state machine information into relational databases. We wouldn't take most of it even if it were free.<p>I think the pubsub system and their library-shelf system were two out of the grand total of three things Amazon does better than google.<p>I guess you could make an argument that their bias for launching early and iterating like mad is also something they do well, but you can argue it either way. They prioritize launching early over everything else, including retention and engineering discipline and a bunch of other stuff that turns out to matter in the long run. So even though it's given them some competitive advantages in the marketplace, it's created enough other problems to make it something less than a slam-dunk.<p>But there's one thing they do really really well that pretty much makes up for ALL of their political, philosophical and technical screw-ups.<p>Jeff Bezos is an infamous micro-manager. He micro-manages every single pixel of Amazon's retail site. He hired Larry Tesler, Apple's Chief Scientist and probably the very most famous and respected human-computer interaction expert in the entire world, and then ignored every goddamn thing Larry said for three years until Larry finally -- wisely -- left the company. Larry would do these big usability studies and demonstrate beyond any shred of doubt that nobody can understand that frigging website, but Bezos just couldn't let go of those pixels, all those millions of semantics-packed pixels on the landing page. They were like millions of his own precious children. So they're all still there, and Larry is not.<p>Micro-managing isn't that third thing that Amazon does better than us, by the way. I mean, yeah, they micro-manage really well, but I wouldn't list it as a strength or anything. I'm just trying to set the context here, to help you understand what happened. We're talking about a guy who in all seriousness has said on many public occasions that people should be paying him to work at Amazon. He hands out little yellow stickies with his name on them, reminding people "who runs the company" when they disagree with him. The guy is a regular... well, Steve Jobs, I guess. Except without the fashion or design sense. Bezos is super smart; don't get me wrong. He just makes ordinary control freaks look like stoned hippies.<p>So one day Jeff Bezos issued a mandate. He's doing that all the time, of course, and people scramble like ants being pounded with a rubber mallet whenever it happens. But on one occasion -- back around 2002 I think, plus or minus a year -- he issued a mandate that was so out there, so huge and eye-bulgingly ponderous, that it made all of his other mandates look like unsolicited peer bonuses.<p>His Big Mandate went something along these lines:<p>1) All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces.<p>2) Teams must communicate with each other through these interfaces.<p>3) There will be no other form of interprocess communication allowed: no direct linking, no direct reads of another team's data store, no shared-memory model, no back-doors whatsoever. The only communication allowed is via service interface calls over the network.<p>4) It doesn't matter what technology they use. HTTP, Corba, Pubsub, custom protocols -- doesn't matter. Bezos doesn't care.<p>5) All service interfaces, without exception, must be designed from the ground up to be externalizable. That is to say, the team must plan and design to be able to expose the interface to developers in the outside world. No exceptions.<p>6) Anyone who doesn't do this will be fired.<p>7) Thank you; have a nice day!<p>Ha, ha! You 150-odd ex-Amazon folks here will of course realize immediately that #7 was a little joke I threw in, because Bezos most definitely does not give a shit about your day.<p>#6, however, was quite real, so people went to work. Bezos assigned a couple of Chief Bulldogs to oversee the effort and ensure forward progress, headed up by Uber-Chief Bear Bulldog Rick Dalzell. Rick is an ex-Armgy Ranger, West Point Academy graduate, ex-boxer, ex-Chief Torturer slash CIO at Wal*Mart, and is a big genial scary man who used the word "hardened interface" a lot. Rick was a walking, talking hardened interface himself, so needless to say, everyone made LOTS of forward progress and made sure Rick knew about it.<p>Over the next couple of years, Amazon transformed internally into a service-oriented architecture. They learned a tremendous amount while effecting this transformation. There was lots of existing documentation and lore about SOAs, but at Amazon's vast scale it was about as useful as telling Indiana Jones to look both ways before crossing the street. Amazon's dev staff made a lot of discoveries along the way. A teeny tiny sampling of these discoveries included:<p>- pager escalation gets way harder, because a ticket might bounce through 20 service calls before the real owner is identified. If each bounce goes through a team with a 15-minute response time, it can be hours before the right team finally finds out, unless you build a lot of scaffolding and metrics and reporting.<p>- every single one of your peer teams suddenly becomes a potential DOS attacker. Nobody can make any real forward progress until very serious quotas and throttling are put in place in every single service.<p>- monitoring and QA are the same thing. You'd never think so until you try doing a big SOA. But when your service says "oh yes, I'm fine", it may well be the case that the only thing still functioning in the server is the little component that knows how to say "I'm fine, roger roger, over and out" in a cheery droid voice. In order to tell whether the service is actually responding, you have to make individual calls. The problem continues recursively until your monitoring is doing comprehensive semantics checking of your entire range of services and data, at which point it's indistinguishable from automated QA. So they're a continuum.<p>- if you have hundreds of services, and your code MUST communicate with other groups' code via these services, then you won't be able to find any of them without a service-discovery mechanism. And you can't have that without a service registration mechanism, which itself is another service. So Amazon has a universal service registry where you can find out reflectively (programmatically) about every service, what its APIs are, and also whether it is currently up, and where.<p>- debugging problems with someone else's code gets a LOT harder, and is basically impossible unless there is a universal standard way to run every service in a debuggable sandbox.<p>That's just a very small sample. There are dozens, maybe hundreds of individual learnings like these that Amazon had to discover organically. There were a lot of wacky ones around externalizing services, but not as many as you might think. Organizing into services taught teams not to trust each other in most of the same ways they're not supposed to trust external developers.<p>This effort was still underway when I left to join Google in mid-2005, but it was pretty far advanced. From the time Bezos issued his edict through the time I left, Amazon had transformed culturally into a company that thinks about everything in a services-first fashion. It is now fundamental to how they approach all designs, including internal designs for stuff that might never see the light of day externally.<p>At this point they don't even do it out of fear of being fired. I mean, they're still afraid of that; it's pretty much part of daily life there, working for the Dread Pirate Bezos and all. But they do services because they've come to understand that it's the Right Thing. There are without question pros and cons to the SOA approach, and some of the cons are pretty long. But overall it's the right thing because SOA-driven design enables Platforms.<p>That's what Bezos was up to with his edict, of course. He didn't (and doesn't) care even a tiny bit about the well-being of the teams, nor about what technologies they use, nor in fact any detail whatsoever about how they go about their business unless they happen to be screwing up. But Bezos realized long before the vast majority of Amazonians that Amazon needs to be a platform.<p>You wouldn't really think that an online bookstore needs to be an extensible, programmable platform. Would you?<p>Well, the first big thing Bezos realized is that the infrastructure they'd built for selling and shipping books and sundry could be transformed an excellent repurposable computing platform. So now they have the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud, and the Amazon Elastic MapReduce, and the Amazon Relational Database Service, and a whole passel' o' other services browsable at aws.amazon.com. These services host the backends for some pretty successful companies, reddit being my personal favorite of the bunch.<p>The other big realization he had was that he can't always build the right thing. I think Larry Tesler might have struck some kind of chord in Bezos when he said his mom couldn't use the goddamn website. It's not even super clear whose mom he was talking about, and doesn't really matter, because nobody's mom can use the goddamn website. In fact I myself find the website disturbingly daunting, and I worked there for over half a decade. I've just learned to kinda defocus my eyes and concentrate on the million or so pixels near the center of the page above the fold.<p>I'm not really sure how Bezos came to this realization -- the insight that he can't build one product and have it be right for everyone. But it doesn't matter, because he gets it. There's actually a formal name for this phenomenon. It's called Accessibility, and it's the most important thing in the computing world.<p>The. Most. Important. Thing.<p>If you're sorta thinking, "huh? You mean like, blind and deaf people Accessibility?" then you're not alone, because I've come to understand that there are lots and LOTS of people just like you: people for whom this idea does not have the right Accessibility, so it hasn't been able to get through to you yet. It's not your fault for not understanding, any more than it would be your fault for being blind or deaf or motion-restricted or living with any other disability. When software -- or idea-ware for that matter -- fails to be accessible to anyone for any reason, it is the fault of the software or of the messaging of the idea. It is an Accessibility failure.<p>Like anything else big and important in life, Accessibility has an evil twin who, jilted by the unbalanced affection displayed by their parents in their youth, has grown into an equally powerful Arch-Nemesis (yes, there's more than one nemesis to accessibility) named Security. And boy howdy are the two ever at odds.<p>But I'll argue that Accessibility is actually more important than Security because dialing Accessibility to zero means you have no product at all, whereas dialing Security to zero can still get you a reasonably successful product such as the Playstation Network.<p>So yeah. In case you hadn't noticed, I could actually write a book on this topic. A fat one, filled with amusing anecdotes about ants and rubber mallets at companies I've worked at. But I will never get this little rant published, and you'll never get it read, unless I start to wrap up.<p>That one last thing that Google doesn't do well is Platforms. We don't understand platforms. We don't "get" platforms. Some of you do, but you are the minority. This has become painfully clear to me over the past six years. I was kind of hoping that competitive pressure from Microsoft and Amazon and more recently Facebook would make us wake up collectively and start doing universal services. Not in some sort of ad-hoc, half-assed way, but in more or less the same way Amazon did it: all at once, for real, no cheating, and treating it as our top priority from now on.<p>But no. No, it's like our tenth or eleventh priority. Or fifteenth, I don't know. It's pretty low. There are a few teams who treat the idea very seriously, but most teams either don't think about it all, ever, or only a small percentage of them think about it in a very small way.<p>It's a big stretch even to get most teams to offer a stubby service to get programmatic access to their data and computations. Most of them think they're building products. And a stubby service is a pretty pathetic service. Go back and look at that partial list of learnings from Amazon, and tell me which ones Stubby gives you out of the box. As far as I'm concerned, it's none of them. Stubby's great, but it's like parts when you need a car.<p>A product is useless without a platform, or more precisely and accurately, a platform-less product will always be replaced by an equivalent platform-ized product.<p>Google+ is a prime example of our complete failure to understand platforms from the very highest levels of executive leadership (hi Larry, Sergey, Eric, Vic, howdy howdy) down to the very lowest leaf workers (hey yo). We all don't get it. The Golden Rule of platforms is that you Eat Your Own Dogfood. The Google+ platform is a pathetic afterthought. We had no API at all at launch, and last I checked, we had one measly API call. One of the team members marched in and told me about it when they launched, and I asked: "So is it the Stalker API?" She got all glum and said "Yeah." I mean, I was joking, but no... the only API call we offer is to get someone's stream. So I guess the joke was on me.<p>Microsoft has known about the Dogfood rule for at least twenty years. It's been part of their culture for a whole generation now. You don't eat People Food and give your developers Dog Food. Doing that is simply robbing your long-term platform value for short-term successes. Platforms are all about long-term thinking.<p>Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product. But that's not why they are successful. Facebook is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work. So Facebook is different for everyone. Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars. Some spend all their time on Farmville. There are hundreds or maybe thousands of different high-quality time sinks available, so there's something there for everyone.<p>Our Google+ team took a look at the aftermarket and said: "Gosh, it looks like we need some games. Let's go contract someone to, um, write some games for us." Do you begin to see how incredibly wrong that thinking is now? The problem is that we are trying to predict what people want and deliver it for them.<p>You can't do that. Not really. Not reliably. There have been precious few people in the world, over the entire history of computing, who have been able to do it reliably. Steve Jobs was one of them. We don't have a Steve Jobs here. I'm sorry, but we don't.<p>Larry Tesler may have convinced Bezos that he was no Steve Jobs, but Bezos realized that he didn't need to be a Steve Jobs in order to provide everyone with the right products: interfaces and workflows that they liked and felt at ease with. He just needed to enable third-party developers to do it, and it would happen automatically.<p>I apologize to those (many) of you for whom all this stuff I'm saying is incredibly obvious, because yeah. It's incredibly frigging obvious. Except we're not doing it. We don't get Platforms, and we don't get Accessibility. The two are basically the same thing, because platforms solve accessibility. A platform is accessibility.<p>So yeah, Microsoft gets it. And you know as well as I do how surprising that is, because they don't "get" much of anything, really. But they understand platforms as a purely accidental outgrowth of having started life in the business of providing platforms. So they have thirty-plus years of learning in this space. And if you go to msdn.com, and spend some time browsing, and you've never seen it before, prepare to be amazed. Because it's staggeringly huge. They have thousands, and thousands, and THOUSANDS of API calls. They have a HUGE platform. Too big in fact, because they can't design for squat, but at least they're doing it.<p>Amazon gets it. Amazon's AWS (aws.amazon.com) is incredible. Just go look at it. Click around. It's embarrassing. We don't have any of that stuff.<p>Apple gets it, obviously. They've made some fundamentally non-open choices, particularly around their mobile platform. But they understand accessibility and they understand the power of third-party development and they eat their dogfood. And you know what? They make pretty good dogfood. Their APIs are a hell of a lot cleaner than Microsoft's, and have been since time immemorial.<p>Facebook gets it. That's what really worries me. That's what got me off my lazy butt to write this thing. I hate blogging. I hate... plussing, or whatever it's called when you do a massive rant in Google+ even though it's a terrible venue for it but you do it anyway because in the end you really do want Google to be successful. And I do! I mean, Facebook wants me there, and it'd be pretty easy to just go. But Google is home, so I'm insisting that we have this little family intervention, uncomfortable as it might be.<p>After you've marveled at the platform offerings of Microsoft and Amazon, and Facebook I guess (I didn't look because I didn't want to get too depressed), head over to developers.google.com and browse a little. Pretty big difference, eh? It's like what your fifth-grade nephew might mock up if he were doing an assignment to demonstrate what a big powerful platform company might be building if all they had, resource-wise, was one fifth grader.<p>Please don't get me wrong here -- I know for a fact that the dev-rel team has had to FIGHT to get even this much available externally. They're kicking ass as far as I'm concerned, because they DO get platforms, and they are struggling heroically to try to create one in an environment that is at best platform-apathetic, and at worst often openly hostile to the idea.<p>I'm just frankly describing what developers.google.com looks like to an outsider. It looks childish. Where's the Maps APIs in there for Christ's sake? Some of the things in there are labs projects. And the APIs for everything I clicked were... they were paltry. They were obviously dog food. Not even good organic stuff. Compared to our internal APIs it's all snouts and horse hooves.<p>And also don't get me wrong about Google+. They're far from the only offenders. This is a cultural thing. What we have going on internally is basically a war, with the underdog minority Platformers fighting a more or less losing battle against the Mighty Funded Confident Producters.<p>Any teams that have successfully internalized the notion that they should be externally programmable platforms from the ground up are underdogs -- Maps and Docs come to mind, and I know GMail is making overtures in that direction. But it's hard for them to get funding for it because it's not part of our culture. Maestro's funding is a feeble thing compared to the gargantuan Microsoft Office programming platform: it's a fluffy rabbit versus a T-Rex. The Docs team knows they'll never be competitive with Office until they can match its scripting facilities, but they're not getting any resource love. I mean, I assume they're not, given that Apps Script only works in Spreadsheet right now, and it doesn't even have keyboard shortcuts as part of its API. That team looks pretty unloved to me.<p>Ironically enough, Wave was a great platform, may they rest in peace. But making something a platform is not going to make you an instant success. A platform needs a killer app. Facebook -- that is, the stock service they offer with walls and friends and such -- is the killer app for the Facebook Platform. And it is a very serious mistake to conclude that the Facebook App could have been anywhere near as successful without the Facebook Platform.<p>You know how people are always saying Google is arrogant? I'm a Googler, so I get as irritated as you do when people say that. We're not arrogant, by and large. We're, like, 99% Arrogance-Free. I did start this post -- if you'll reach back into distant memory -- by describing Google as "doing everything right". We do mean well, and for the most part when people say we're arrogant it's because we didn't hire them, or they're unhappy with our policies, or something along those lines. They're inferring arrogance because it makes them feel better.<p>But when we take the stance that we know how to design the perfect product for everyone, and believe you me, I hear that a lot, then we're being fools. You can attribute it to arrogance, or naivete, or whatever -- it doesn't matter in the end, because it's foolishness. There IS no perfect product for everyone.<p>And so we wind up with a browser that doesn't let you set the default font size. Talk about an affront to Accessibility. I mean, as I get older I'm actually going blind. For real. I've been nearsighted all my life, and once you hit 40 years old you stop being able to see things up close. So font selection becomes this life-or-death thing: it can lock you out of the product completely. But the Chrome team is flat-out arrogant here: they want to build a zero-configuration product, and they're quite brazen about it, and Fuck You if you're blind or deaf or whatever. Hit Ctrl-+ on every single page visit for the rest of your life.<p>It's not just them. It's everyone. The problem is that we're a Product Company through and through. We built a successful product with broad appeal -- our search, that is -- and that wild success has biased us.<p>Amazon was a product company too, so it took an out-of-band force to make Bezos understand the need for a platform. That force was their evaporating margins; he was cornered and had to think of a way out. But all he had was a bunch of engineers and all these computers... if only they could be monetized somehow... you can see how he arrived at AWS, in hindsight.<p>Microsoft started out as a platform, so they've just had lots of practice at it.<p>Facebook, though: they worry me. I'm no expert, but I'm pretty sure they started off as a Product and they rode that success pretty far. So I'm not sure exactly how they made the transition to a platform. It was a relatively long time ago, since they had to be a platform before (now very old) things like Mafia Wars could come along.<p>Maybe they just looked at us and asked: "How can we beat Google? What are they missing?"<p>The problem we face is pretty huge, because it will take a dramatic cultural change in order for us to start catching up. We don't do internal service-oriented platforms, and we just as equally don't do external ones. This means that the "not getting it" is endemic across the company: the PMs don't get it, the engineers don't get it, the product teams don't get it, nobody gets it. Even if individuals do, even if YOU do, it doesn't matter one bit unless we're treating it as an all-hands-on-deck emergency. We can't keep launching products and pretending we'll turn them into magical beautiful extensible platforms later. We've tried that and it's not working.<p>The Golden Rule of Platforms, "Eat Your Own Dogfood", can be rephrased as "Start with a Platform, and Then Use it for Everything." You can't just bolt it on later. Certainly not easily at any rate -- ask anyone who worked on platformizing MS Office. Or anyone who worked on platformizing Amazon. If you delay it, it'll be ten times as much work as just doing it correctly up front. You can't cheat. You can't have secret back doors for internal apps to get special priority access, not for ANY reason. You need to solve the hard problems up front.<p>I'm not saying it's too late for us, but the longer we wait, the closer we get to being Too Late.<p>I honestly don't know how to wrap this up. I've said pretty much everything I came here to say today. This post has been six years in the making. I'm sorry if I wasn't gentle enough, or if I misrepresented some product or team or person, or if we're actually doing LOTS of platform stuff and it just so happens that I and everyone I ever talk to has just never heard about it. I'm sorry.<p>But we've gotta start doing this right.";s:12:"story_author";s:4:"tRAS";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"65";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3101876";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}}s:5:"stats";s:0:"";s:8:"checksum";i:4246816292;s:10:"warmupTime";d:12095;s:6:"retest";b:1;}i:14;a:15:{s:10:"avgFastest";i:21421;s:2:"cv";d:21.82;s:3:"avg";d:22386;s:12:"cvAvgFastest";d:0.67;s:4:"cold";d:50327;s:7:"fastest";d:21177;s:7:"slowest";d:50327;s:5:"times";a:34:{i:0;d:50327;i:1;d:23905;i:2;d:21402;i:3;d:21244;i:4;d:21177;i:5;d:21507;i:6;d:21305;i:7;d:21781;i:8;d:21354;i:9;d:21487;i:10;d:21213;i:11;d:21704;i:12;d:21478;i:13;d:21589;i:14;d:21388;i:15;d:21663;i:16;d:21547;i:17;d:21411;i:18;d:21627;i:19;d:21671;i:20;d:21332;i:21;d:21295;i:22;d:21348;i:23;d:21650;i:24;d:21251;i:25;d:21670;i:26;d:21414;i:27;d:21284;i:28;d:21576;i:29;d:21525;i:30;d:21572;i:31;d:21688;i:32;d:21204;i:33;d:21543;}s:13:"originalQuery";s:58:"select * from hn_small where match('abc -google') limit 20";s:13:"modifiedQuery";s:136:"select * from hn_small where match(story_text,story_author,comment_text,comment_author) against ('abc -google' IN BOOLEAN MODE) limit 20";s:6:"result";a:20:{i:0;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"53";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"liedra";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1404074";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"8";s:12:"comment_text";s:807:"There are a whole boatload of awesome podcasts available at the Australian ABC Radio National.

This is unquestionably a solid way to prove things about your program but it is too much of pain to expect this to have significant adoption in the &quot;real&quot; world.<p>In the hardware world, there&#x27;s been a lot of progress in automated verification thanks to modern model checkers [1,2] (which incidentally build on modern SAT, and in some cases SMT, solvers [3-6]). The nice thing about model checkers is that you just specify the property you want proven and let the verifier crunch away and it will (hopefully) come up with a proof or a counterexample. This has been successful enough that there are companies like JASPER and OneSpin which make money by selling hardware companies formal verification tools.<p>I worked with JASPER&#x27;s tools in the recent-ish past and one of the big things they seem to have done is make the tool much more usable. With the JASPER tool, it was much less of a pain to configure the model checker, abstract away parts of the design, keep track of the properties specified and proven, examine counter example traces and so forth than I was expecting. A lot of this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t get done in academic tools like ABC because it doesn&#x27;t count as research. But such improvements are extremely important if you want to push adoption of formal tools in an industrial setting. And from what I can see the emphasis on usability seems to paying off for JASPER.<p>Model checking in software has been less successful because the state explosion problem is much more pronounced but there have been notable success stories like Microsoft Research&#x27;s SLAM project [7]. And I definitely think there is an opportunity here to build upon the algorithmic progress in automated verification in order to build tools that are much usable in a software setting.<p>[1] <a href="http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bradleya/ic3/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecee.colorado.edu&#x2F;~bradleya&#x2F;ic3&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/abc.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~alanmi&#x2F;abc&#x2F;abc.htm</a><p>[3] <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.princeton.edu&#x2F;~chaff&#x2F;zchaff.html</a><p>[4] <a href="http://minisat.se/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;minisat.se&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fmv.jku.at&#x2F;picosat&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href="http://z3.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;z3.codeplex.com&#x2F;</a><p>[7] <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;projects&#x2F;slam&#x2F;</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"dllthomas";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7618406";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:5;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"318";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"Joakal";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"2108761";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1960:"Some research material I found on poverty:<p>Don't fall in the poverty trap, you might never get out (Best): <a href="http://trueslant.com/megancottrell/2009/11/13/dont-fall-in-the-poverty-trap-you-might-never-get-out/" rel="nofollow">http://trueslant.com/megancottrell/2009/11/13/dont-fall-in-t...</a><p>Economics of being poor (Second best): <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/17/AR2009051702053.html" rel="nofollow">https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/0...</a><p>Poor nutrition stunts growth of millions: <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/12/2740530.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/12/2740530.htm</a><p>Life on $234 a week: no fresh food, holidays or visits to the doctor: <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/lifematters/life-on-234-a-week-no-fresh-food-holidays-or-visits-to-the-doctor-20110104-19f57.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.smh.com.au/lifestyle/lifematters/life-on-234-a-we...</a> (You hear all about a dollar a day feeds the poor elsewhere)<p>The paradox of American poverty: <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/sep/17/census-bureau-poverty" rel="nofollow">http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/cifamerica/2010/sep/...</a><p>Poverty not Taliban causing war: Afghans: <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/18/2746886.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/18/2746886.htm</a><p>Statistics and pictures of children in poverty: <a href="http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/featured/poverty-forces-children-sleep-strangest-places/15237" rel="nofollow">http://www.environmentalgraffiti.com/featured/poverty-forces...</a><p>Poor people spend 9% of yearly income on lottery tickets: <a href="http://www.walletpop.com/2010/05/31/poor-people-spend-9-of-income-on-lottery-tickets-heres-why/" rel="nofollow">http://www.walletpop.com/2010/05/31/poor-people-spend-9-of-i...</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:10:"jamesbritt";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"13";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"2108564";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:6;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"405";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"rwhitman";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3946337";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"1";s:12:"comment_text";s:2531:"I was forwarded this email from one of the producers before it aired back in 2009.

Subject: Shark Tank on ABC<p>Hello,<p>My name is TrXXX and I'm contacting you from Mark Burnett Productions and ABC regarding a new show called Shark Tank.  See the trailer here: <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/sharktank/index?pn=index" rel="nofollow">http://abc.go.com/primetime/sharktank/index?pn=index</a><p>It's incredibly hard to get a small business loan from a bank right now.  This show provides the opportunity for a smart entrepreneur or inventor to pitch a product/idea or established business to a group of billionaire investors.  We are looking specifically for a up and coming fashion designer, someone who has a line but wants to expand their business.<p>The premise of Shark Tank is simple: you would approach a panel of billionaire investors (see list below) to explain how much money you would need and how much stake they would receive in turn, and get your company, project or invention more capital to either get started or expand the business.  The panel invests their own money if they decide to go with your proposal, and the outcome could be an amazing opportunity.<p>If you are interested in being on this show or have an email list you can circulate this announcement to,  please do so.  We are trying to extend this opportunity to as many people as possible.<p>Directions: each interested person should email me directly (XXX@gmail.com) with the following information:<p>Name
Occupation
Description of Business/Invention (non-confidential)
Phone number
Email
Photo<p>Once I receive this, I will send an email that you need to reply to.  From there, you can receive an application.  Don't wait, we are filming this show in July and are screening applicants now.<p>Panel of Investors:<p>Robert Herjavec (Tech Genius)
Daymond John (Founder of FUBU clothing)
Barbara Corcoran (Real Estate Mogul)<p>Kevin O'Leary (Venture Capitalist)

</code></pre>
In other editors:<p><pre><code>  to delete "abc" from the left:
   put the cursor on the a
   C-d C-d C-d

  to delete "abc" from the right:
   put the cursor on the character after the c (the d)
   C-h C-h C-h

  to delete "def" from the left:
   put the cursor on the d
   C-d C-d C-d

  to delete "def" from the right:
   put the cursor on the character after the f (the EOL)
   C-h C-h C-h
</code></pre>
Symmetrical and consistent, to my mind.<p>In Vim:<p><pre><code>  to delete "abc" from the left:
   put the cursor before the a
   xxx

 to delete "abc" from the right:
   put the cursor on the character after the c (the d)
   XXX

 to delete "def" from the left:
   put the cursor on the d
   xxx

 to delete "def" from the right:
   put the cursor on the f
   xxx
</code></pre>
The last case there is exceptional. It's a small thing, but not being able to put the cursor on a real or virtual 'end-of-line' character in Vim makes me feel constricted.<p>I think that the <i>between</i> chars cursor model is simpler because you then have two choices: act on the preceding chars (thus, delete with C-h or &#60;Backspace&#62;) or act on the succeeding chars (thus, delete with C-d or &#60;Delete&#62;). By contrast Vim is more complicated because from the current <i>character</i> you have three choices: act on the preceding chars (thus, delete with X), act on the current char (thus, delete with x), and the principle of 'completeness' suggests a third: act on the succeeding chars - which AFAIK is not available in Vim and so it feels lop-sided to me.<p>Ironically I think that it's my 'programmer head' which makes the <i>between</i> chars model appeal to me more, as I think of the file as a bunch of bytes (well, maybe multibyte characters) and the text editor as a glorified hex editor, and I just want to choose a position and insert or delete chars regardless of whether they're alphanumeric, LFs, or whatever. Whereas Vim's model of manipulating words, lines and sentences suggests to me a fit with people writing in human languages. Why, non-geeks should love Vim, perhaps except for all the key commands to learn; one imagines an alternate universe where the common keyboard evolved with two Return keys instead of one, labelled "Open new line above" and "Open new line below", and other Vim-inspired niceties - and I wonder whether your archetypal 'grandmother' might find it easier to write letters on the computer in that world than her current futzing about in Microsoft Word.";s:12:"story_author";s:4:"ez77";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"20";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"2911930";s:10:"story_text";s:216:"Inspired by a comment [1] made today by kaylarose.

He never responded (or somehow I never saw a response).<p>Here is a snip from the first email:<p>Begin ---%&lt;------------%&lt;---------------------------------<p>As I understand it, the algorithm, expressed in Python is:<p><pre><code>    #########################
    import sys
    from string import ascii_uppercase as alphabet
    #         ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    LETTER = &quot;31415926535897932384626433&quot;
    NUMBER = [0,2,4,6,8,1,3,5,7,9]

    def f(ch):
        assert ch in (alphabet + &quot;0123456789&quot;)
        if ch in alphabet:
            return int(LETTER[alphabet.index(ch)])
        if ch in &quot;0123456789&quot;:
            return int(ch)

    def g(n):
        return NUMBER[(NUMBER.index(n) + 1) % 10]

    def pw(s):
        digit = g((f(s[0]) + f(s[-1])) % 10)
        result = [digit]
        for c in s[1:]:
            digit = g((digit + f(c)) % 10)
            result.append(digit)
        return result

    print(sys.argv[1], pw(sys.argv[1]))
    #########################
</code></pre>
Consider a few results from encryption and what it presents to the adversary:<p><pre><code>    pw(ABC)     == 928
    pw(ABCABC)  == 928362
</code></pre>
If ABC is a seed to the algorithm, then any seed that shares a prefix and a final character will have information leaked, sometimes enough to reveal the entire generated password for a different seed.<p>Its actually worse than this.  For example, if the adversary knows that:<p><pre><code>    pw(AAT)  == 941
    pw(ABC)  == 928
    pw(BBC)  == 717
</code></pre>
then the adversary knows that the mapping from the character C to an integer is the same as the mapping from character T.  Using the terminology presented in the lecture this is<p><pre><code>    f(C) == f(T)
</code></pre>
and from this adversary can determine information about the result of the password algorithm on other seeds.<p><pre><code>    pw(BBT)  == 717
    pw(B.*T) == 7.*
</code></pre>
Because the algorithm uses a recurrence that generates one ciphertext character from the result of preceding  ciphertext character, the adversary can make further inferences:<p><pre><code>    pw(BAT)  == 728
</code></pre>
which implies that if the preceding ciphertext is 7 and the current seed character is A that the resulting ciphertext will be 2.  Consider<p><pre><code>    pw(BAT)   == 728
    pw(XAB)   == 725
    pw(XAAB)  == 7271
    pw(XAAAB) == 72725
</code></pre>

    TRAIN -&gt; 27732
    GRAIN -&gt; 35618
    DRAIN -&gt; 54349
</code></pre>
One can conclude that the permutation of [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] that controls the mapping g() must be one of the cycles:<p><pre><code>    6159073428

</code></pre>
In fact, with a bit more work one can deduce that it is the second by making use of the additional plaintext&#x2F;ciphertext pair (which appears on the same slide):<p><pre><code>    AND -&gt; 496
</code></pre>
So now we know that<p><pre><code>    g(0) -&gt; 6
    g(1) -&gt; 0
    g(2) -&gt; 7
    g(3) -&gt; 5
    g(4) -&gt; 8
    g(5) -&gt; 0
    g(6) -&gt; 2
    g(7) -&gt; 9
    g(8) -&gt; 1
    g(9) -&gt; 3
</code></pre>
With g() in hand, it is short work to build up the mapping of f().  For these five words, the letters involved are A, B, D, G, I, N, R, and T.<p><pre><code>    f(A) -&gt; 5
    f(B) -&gt; 8
    f(D) -&gt; 0
    f(G) -&gt; 6
    f(I) -&gt; 2
    f(N) -&gt; 3
    f(R) -&gt; 0
    f(T) -&gt; 0
</code></pre>
Notes on decryption
===================<p>The details of this decryption aren&#x27;t very interesting, so I wont go into detail.  I didn&#x27;t need to use a computer, just paper and pencil.  The important observation was that from BRAIN -&gt; 06076 one knows<p>g(0 + f(R)) -&gt; 6<p>and from TRAIN -&gt; 27732 one knows<p>g(2 + f(R)) -&gt; 7<p>thus if g(k) -&gt; 6, g(k+2) -&gt; 7.<p>This means that map(g, [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]) is some rotation of the list [_,_,_,_6,_,7,_,_,_,_] where 6 and 7 are at two locations apart.<p>Every letter, say &#x27;A&#x27;, which appears in more than two places in any of the plaintext&#x2F;ciphertext pairs reveals information about g().  So BRAIN -&gt; 06076
and TRAIN -&gt; 27732 also reveals that<p>g(6 + f(A)) -&gt; 0  and  g(7 + f(A)) -&gt; 7<p>Therefore, if g(k) -&gt; 0 then g(k+1) -&gt; 7.  Thus, we can now conclude that map(g, [0,...,9]) is some rotation of [_,_,_,_,6,0,7,_,_,_].<p>In this fashion I concluded that map(g,[0,...,9]) was some rotation of
[2,9,1,3,6,0,7,5,8,4].  I knew that g()&#x27;s corresponding permutation was a circular permutation with a single cycle because that was a part of the system that makes it easier to memorize.<p>In general, of course, there could be ten possible mappings, one for each rotation.  However, in practice some of these rotations
won&#x27;t produce a permutation with a single cycle.  This isn&#x27;t really a problem because ten possible mappings for g() are still easy to validate in the next phase where we derive the mapping f().  In this particular case, there were only two possible circular permutations making it easy to decrypt the system with just paper and pencil.<p>The next step is to try out each of the possible g()&#x27;s determined above on the plaintext&#x2F;ciphertext pairs.  For example, BRAIN -&gt; 06076 implies that<p>g(0 + f(R)) = 6<p>applying the inverse map of g() to both sides<p>0 + f(R) = 0<p>so<p>f(R) -&gt; 0<p>In this manner the entire decryption can be performed.<p>End ---%&lt;------------%&lt;---------------------------------";s:12:"story_author";s:8:"jalcazar";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"24";s:8:"story_id";s:8:"10196485";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:15;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"129";s:14:"comment_author";s:5:"femto";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"6624882";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"6";s:12:"comment_text";s:380:"&quot;Catalyst&quot;, the ABC&#x27;s weekly science show, had an interesting investigation into this last Thursday [1].

So he's intrigued by the promise of a next-generation battery called an ultracapacitor, capable of powering everything from cars to tractors. Unlike chemical batteries, ultracapacitors store energy as an electrical field between a pair of conducting plates. Theoretically, they can be charged in less than a second rather than hours, be recharged repeatedly without sacrificing performance, and far outlast anything now on the market.<p>"I am convinced that the long-term solution to our energy needs lies with capacitors," Musk says. "You can't beat them for power, and they kick ass on any chemical battery."<p>Musk would know: He was doing Ph.D. work at Stanford on high-energy capacitors before he helped get PayPal off the ground. At least one startup, EEStor in Texas, and a larger company, Maxwell Technologies in California, are working on ultracapacitors. Yet Musk believes a university-based research group has an equal shot at a commercial breakthrough, since universities are where the most promising research is bubbling up. "The challenge is one of materials science, not money," Musk says.<p>The team to pull this off, he says, would need expertise in materials science, applied physics, and manufacturing. Musk wants to see a prototype that can power something small, like a boom box. "Make one and show me that it works," Musk says.

It may very well be that Broder got a swimming pool full of BP-money in his offshore hideaway...but isn't it possible that just <i>maybe</i>, that Elon Musk has a vested interest in advocating for Tesla? Like, just a little bit?<p>It doesn't have to be that Musk is trying to cover up the truth. It could just be that this is his big project and he is overly sensitive to (some of it admittedly unfair) criticism to the point where he'll see malice where there is none. It's possible: bias from sentimental influence is not unheard of in the scientific community.<p>One of the most disappointing things about Musk's response was how he closed it with an out-of-context anecdote:<p><i>In his own words in an article published last year, this is how Broder felt about electric cars before even seeing the Model S:
"Yet the state of the electric car is dismal, the victim of hyped expectations, technological flops, high costs and a hostile political climate.</i><p>If you read that article, Broder was clearly referring to the controversy behind the Chevy Volt, which he also compared unfavorably to a "lawnmower".<p>Oh wait, that was Elon Musk who said that:

It is unusual for a company so young to start pushing sales via financing. More so when the package includes a 3y repurchase obligation.<p>Start with Elon Musk personally backing the repurchase agreement. Was the bank unwilling to to take this risk? Why could they believe they can't securitise the risk? Granted this is U.S. Bancorp and Wells Fargo we're talking about. Will the risk live on Tesla's balance sheet? The silver lining would be the clarity investors will get into the assumptions that went into pricing the put.<p>Why we are already talking about financing? Wasn't the plan to improve accessibility by driving down prices through increasingly mass market models? Who is the marginal customer who balked at the cash price but is shifted by this? The one who doesn't have the cash? Or couldn't get a bank loan? These customers are probably less credit-worthy than Tesla's cash customers. The repurchase agreement is a callable loan to borrowers willing to fund a large discretionary purchase with debt. This will come home to roost if U.S. growth and thus incomes tank and erstwhile enthusiastic greenies start seeing their vroom vrooms as piggie banks.<p>We know that part of what pushed Tesla into profitability was its re-working of its DoE loan. Is this a way to pull forward sales? How are these "leases" accounted for when they're made? I'm keeping an eye open for if they recognise the full value of the sale, less an ignomiously small loss reserve, upon signing.<p>Comparatively minor but still irking me: why is Elon Musk implying his credit is better than Tesla's? Tesla has more loss-absorbing capital. Given the amount of Musk's net worth tied up in Tesla, his credit has a high correlation with Tesla's.

This is worse than sideways acceleration: track standards for vertical acceleration are tighter than for horizontal acceleration, about 0.5-0.67 m&#x2F;s^2, one tenth to one seventh what Musk wants to subject his passengers to. Its not transportation; its a barf ride.<p>The barf ride that is as expensive as California HSR and takes as long door-to-door is also very low-capacity.(...) The proposed headway is 30 seconds, for 3,360 passengers per direction per hour. (...) HSR can do 12,000 passengers per direction per hour: 12 trains per hour is possible (...)

Really. I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on.

We're a long way away from a real cure, but survival rates have never been higher.<p>- Incredible advances in arthroscopic &#38; noninvasive/outpatient surgery &#38; procedures: In 2004-ish I blew out the "terrible triad" of knee ligaments; my surgery scars are just little dots.

I do interviews at a large Internet company, and one of my goals--one of the goals that I've been trained to seek--is to ensure that the candidate, no matter how bad, walks away from the interview feeling good about himself/herself and the company.  If you're doing really poorly in an interview, I'll toss you some easier questions than I normally give, because I have all the information I need, and I don't want you to have a negative experience with my company.  You may have felt good about the phone screens, but the most likely explanation for the two companies that didn't bring you onsite is that you didn't actually do well enough to justify additional interviews.

I sent emails to ~50 different companies (some well-known, others unknown) that were looking for "Sr. Developers", particularly Ruby devs, as found on the major developer job sites (stackoverflow, Dice, Indeed, 37signals etc). I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting. I also picked companies that most closely matched my skillset. In my email I introduced myself and included my resume. Here is how I am represented in the email (paraphrased from actual text, ):<p>Given: X &#62; 7 &#38; Y &#62; 4,<p>"Sr. Level Developer, with X years exp. Y years of prof exp with Ruby.

You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc".

If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment. Some of that equipment is located onboard a fire truck or an ambulance. Most of that equipment is usually found inside the operating room of your local hospital.

The subtle difference is that even if you don't disclose on your resume, you need to consider whether they would be ok if they found out post-hire.  You might say "yeah I didn't mention it because it wasn't relevant to my candidacy" but you should consider that they might have an issue and what the consequences might be... ostracized and thus sidelined for promotion by management, even loose your job perhaps, etc. <i>(I personally would hope not, but that is the crux of your dilemma in your OP is that others might)</i><p>2) Even if its not on the resume you probably need + should disclose all of the projects you are working on during the interview/negotiation stage because most employment contracts will ask you to disclose any possible conflict of interest + you will want to ring-fence your IP so that they can't claim your next venture started post-hire belongs to them (see also <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1685431" rel="nofollow">http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1685431</a>)<p>When I was 17 I ran a pretty successful free email site in the UK called fuckyou.co.uk.

By sketchy, I mean that they may offend someone of a particular set, but are otherwise (in my opinion) brilliant executions that I'm proud of. I've never done anything illegal, and I like to think I have a solid base of ethics.<p>For example, when I was around 17, I picked up a trademarked domain for a popular music group from expiry (they didn't own it prior, was just a holding page for non-related topic). I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for "bling" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate. I offered email service, networked with other hip hop sites, and made about $100k from adsense before I was graciously C&#38;D'd and handed the name over.<p>Most recently I cofounded a project that was covered on the sites of TIME, CBS, Business Insider, Gawker, and pending an ABC News article. It made the front page of HN as well (thanks guys). That site was Price Of Weed, where we crowdsource and share information about the price people pay for marijuana. Possession is still illegal in most of the world; its easy to assume I'm some sort of stoner/drug pusher because I'm associated with this project, but in reality I don't smoke much at all.<p>Now I'm a biz guy and probably won't be applying to jobs at big corporations. I'd really like to work for a startup, which I believe would be less judgmental and more accepting of my project history. If you were me, would you stick these projects on your resume? What are your own experiences with sharing this kind of information with potential employers?

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5834687";s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment. Some of that equipment is located onboard a fire truck or an ambulance. Most of that equipment is usually found inside the operating room of your local hospital.

Like the certainty that big oil has had the knowledge of clean, cheap energy and that they keep it secret to make money on oil... or that they&#x27;ll pump up oil prices to lure the alternative energy people to make business risks, and then purposely flood the market in order to put them out of business, etc.";s:12:"story_author";s:10:"tokenadult";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"8386268";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:10;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:4:"3504";s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"tokenadult";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"7820120";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:6442:"Volokh here is decrying the same kinds of policies that I decry, for many of the same reasons.

That kind of categorization was wrong and a moral outrage in the days of Jim Crow legally enforced segregation and it is still a bad idea today, even to correct the previous wrong.<p>I care about this issue deeply. I&#x27;m a baby boomer, which is another way of saying that I&#x27;m a good bit older than most people who post on Hacker News. I distinctly remember the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated--the most memorable day of early childhood for many people in my generation--and I remember the &quot;long hot summer&quot; and other events of the 1960s civil rights movement.<p>One early memory I have is of a second grade classmate (I still remember his name, which alas is just common enough that it is hard to Google him up) who moved back to Minnesota with his northern &quot;white&quot; parents after spending his early years in Alabama. He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was &quot;Negroes&quot;), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. He made me aware of a society in which people didn&#x27;t all treat one another with decency and human compassion, unlike the only kind of society I was initially aware of from growing up where I did. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn&#x27;t shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC) affirmative action program. (To me, the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don&#x27;t.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;Afro-American&quot; or &quot;black&quot; was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, &quot;What do you want to be called, &#x27;black&#x27; or &#x27;Afro-American&#x27;?&quot; His answer was, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be called Henry.&quot; Henry&#x27;s answer to my classmate&#x27;s innocent question really got me thinking. Why not treat all of my neighbors as individuals, one at a time?<p>And anyway I&#x27;ve seen this issue go wrong for people in other countries. Also in my childhood, in the other state I lived in growing up, I had a classmate in the early 1970s who would get on the school bus each day wearing a button that said &quot;Serb Power.&quot; I thought that was very strange, because I knew my history well enough to know that Serbia hadn&#x27;t been an independent country since Yugoslavia was formed after World War I. And, anyway, he was living in the United States and had been born here, so why was he so concerned about Serb power? We all found out during the early 1990s how crazy many people in Yugoslavia were about former historical grievances, which made that country disintegrate and killed many innocent people born long after the grievances should have been forgotten.<p>Most reporting to the federal government about &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; is based on the U.S. Census bureau definitions for ethnicity and race categories, which in turn are based on regulations from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which were announced on 30 October 1997<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitehouse.gov&#x2F;omb&#x2F;fedreg_1997standards</a><p>to take effect no later than 1 January 2003 for data collection by all federal agencies. You can look up the detailed category definitions on the website of the United States Bureau of the Census. As the Census Bureau itself notes,<p>&quot;U.S. federal government agencies must adhere to standards issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in October 1997, which specify that  race  and Hispanic origin (also known as ethnicity) are two separate and distinct concepts.  These standards generally reflect a social definition of race and ethnicity recognized in this country and they do not conform to any biological, anthropological, or genetic criteria.  The standards include five minimum categories for data on race:  &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native,&quot; &quot;Asian,&quot; &quot;Black or African American,&quot; &quot;Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,&quot; and &quot;White.&quot;  There are two minimum categories for data on ethnicity:  &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; and &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino.&quot;  The concept of race reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify.  Persons who report themselves as Hispanic can be of any race and are identified as such in our data tables.&quot;<p><a href="https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.census.gov&#x2F;faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191</a><p>It&#x27;s politics all the way down.

You prove your theorems more or less by typing out the proofs and the system mechanically verifies that each step in your proof is sound. I&#x27;ve used Coq and I&#x27;ll be honest. This is unquestionably a solid way to prove things about your program but it is too much of pain to expect this to have significant adoption in the &quot;real&quot; world.<p>In the hardware world, there&#x27;s been a lot of progress in automated verification thanks to modern model checkers [1,2] (which incidentally build on modern SAT, and in some cases SMT, solvers [3-6]). The nice thing about model checkers is that you just specify the property you want proven and let the verifier crunch away and it will (hopefully) come up with a proof or a counterexample. This has been successful enough that there are companies like JASPER and OneSpin which make money by selling hardware companies formal verification tools.<p>I worked with JASPER&#x27;s tools in the recent-ish past and one of the big things they seem to have done is make the tool much more usable. With the JASPER tool, it was much less of a pain to configure the model checker, abstract away parts of the design, keep track of the properties specified and proven, examine counter example traces and so forth than I was expecting. A lot of this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t get done in academic tools like ABC because it doesn&#x27;t count as research. But such improvements are extremely important if you want to push adoption of formal tools in an industrial setting.

Really. I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on.

The majority of my students are experienced programmers, but no small number are new to programming beyond very simple stuff.   I&#x27;ve found that Python has a number of aspects that are ideal for first-time programmers:<p>- It&#x27;s dynamically typed.  Say what you want about static vs. dynamic typing, but this is one less thing that newbie programmers have to get right.  There&#x27;s no chance of an error when they say &quot;i = &#x27;abc&#x27;&quot;, if you&#x27;ve defined i to be an int.<p>- It&#x27;s interactive.  The fact that you can &quot;play&quot; with the language within the interactive shell is a huge selling point.  IPython and the IPython Notebook are easy to get working, and for people to work with.<p>- Python&#x27;s restricted command set and simple, regular syntax let you concentrate on ideas: Yes, many newbies to Python (and to programming in general) get confused by indentation, blocks, colons, and the like.  But they&#x27;re going to get confused by the syntax of nearly any language.  Python has a simpler syntax than most other languages, meaning that there&#x27;s less to learn, and less to remember.  This lets the new programmer concentrate on the ideas that they&#x27;re learning, or the implementation of what they&#x27;re doing.<p>- It&#x27;s cross platform.  The fact that people can use Python on any computer they like is a big selling point.<p>- You can easily teach object-oriented and functional-style programming.  Python is obviously object-oriented, but can also be used to introduce functional programming.  In this way, you can expose programmers not only to multiple paradigms in Python, but also in other languages.<p>- You can use it for real applications.  People are often surprised to discover that real-life applications are being written and used in this language that they&#x27;re learning, which seems so simple.<p>I&#x27;m sure that there are more reasons than these.  But let&#x27;s consider the alternatives that the article suggested:<p>- I would be hard-pressed to think of a <i>worse</i> first language than C.  You want to introduce people to the concepts of programming, which means abstractions and high-level thinking.  C forces you to think in terms of the computer and its memory, which is just the opposite.  The fact that it&#x27;s compiled to binary form, that you don&#x27;t have an interactive C shell, and pointers are just three reasons why I think that C would be a very bad choice.  Sure, everyone should learn C at some point -- although I often point out that I&#x27;m a much happier person since I moved to dynamic, high-level languages many years ago -- but if you want to teach the concepts of programming, C is going to require too much learning just to get simple things done.<p>- JavaScript has many good points for beginning programmers -- but the chief problem, in my mind, is the language&#x27;s syntax, which is far too inconsistent and forgiving&#x2F;flexible for newbies.  I think that someone coming to JavaScript from Python will have a very easy time; the mapping of data types is fairly straightforward, and even the notion of passing functions is pretty easy to get.  But the learning curve in JavaScript seems steeper to me than in Python, despite the obvious advantages of being able to work within a browser.";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"btimil";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7122163";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:17;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"70";s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"robbiet480";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"5999686";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:3795:"(latest info at bottom of comment)<p>ABC reports it was coming from Taipei, linked forum says Taipei.

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5834687";s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

It&#x27;s a matter of fraud, it just happens to take place online, and probably in more places than just yelp.com.  Since it&#x27;s fraud, they have an obligation to investigate and prosecute it, and a sting operation like this is probably one of the most effective means of doing so.<p>This is New York saying they care about their businesses, and that they&#x27;re willing to take action to protect them.

For freelancers it is portfolio management, lead generation and (eventually) contracting and payment services.<p>We are focusing the search to be local (Designers in Portland) and not on specific cost (a 'competitive' search yields the ~65% of the market) This is much different than many other sites that really focus on bidding to the lowest cost in the world.  We are not that.<p>Our broad statement is: professional tools for freelancers.  Our shorter motto is: celebrate freelance.<p>We are working to build a site that allows search on:

But in actual practice, I&#x27;m not convinced it will be so bad.<p>Because if you&#x27;re not using that Yahoo account for e-mail anymore, then you&#x27;re probably not using it as a sign-in or password recovery e-mail for your banking, Facebook, or anything else important -- because the whole point is, everything that&#x27;s actually important to you, you&#x27;re using your current e-mail address. After all, that&#x27;s where important account notifications go, credit card receipts, bank statements, password resets, etc. -- things which are necessary for you to see.<p>Of course you&#x27;ll likely have a bunch of accounts you forgot even existed on random sites you signed up for in the past, with your old Yahoo e-mail address. Most of them will be harmless -- who cares if someone gets access to some random sports forum you once posted on.<p>The biggest risk I can see is that 1) the new owner chooses to be malicious, 2) successfully locates a site that sends out password-recovery emails with the original passwords in plaintext, which the specific user has an account on, 3) knows the original user&#x27;s current valid address, 4) tries the old password on the user&#x27;s new address they use with banking&#x2F;etc., and it works. But the risk of this would appear to be so small, that it&#x27;s just lumped in with all the other kinds of &quot;identity theft&quot; weaknesses that already exist (guessing security questions, etc.).<p>(And then, there&#x27;s scamming on whatever social networks or forums the old e-mail address had an account on. Although it seems like Facebook etc. is protecting against that? And it&#x27;s not like spoofing e-mails&#x2F;accounts is anything new.)<p>As long as Yahoo is giving significant heavy warning to the e-mail accounts themselves, and months&#x27; worth of time -- well if you never check your free e-mail account, it&#x27;s not unreasonable to expect that it might be deactivated someday. Annoying, but not unreasonable. And if you use the same password for your Facebook, banking, etc. as you did for other random sites you signed up for years ago, then that&#x27;s a security risk regardless of what Yahoo does.";s:12:"story_author";s:5:"b0ing";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"24";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"6074617";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:8;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"563";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"wheels";s:10:"comment_id";s:6:"125538";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:2625:"You can learn (or incidentally, not learn) CS at most decent colleges.

Only 20% girls, in the middle of nowhere, the people that I talked to didn't really seem to like it, but all assured me "that it was really a great college."<p>Then I visited the liberal arts school.  That was definitely the right choice.  As it were, I had some great professors that really took an interest in my research and my life.  I learned a lot about literature and philosophy and psychology and history and hung out with folks that weren't just gear heads.  My world grew wider, not just deeper.<p>Now, many years later I realize that after the first two years or so of CS I knew enough to be able to understand and find hard problems.  But if I'd not been forced to take that massive block of core classes, I might have never realized that psychology is really interesting, that there are a lot of parallels between the way that architechts and programmers think or that you can meet a lot of cute girls if you hang out in the music department.<p>So, why is that important?<p>Well, when I was submitting my proposal for my senior research,  I was stressed out because it didn't fit neatly into a specific department.  It was on the line between CS, physics and biology.  My advisor said something that's stuck with me to this day:<p>"The interesting problems of the coming decades of computer science lie at the intersection between computer science and other fields."<p>Getting a solid grasp on computer science in my opinion is critically important, but it's also pretty ubiquitous.  (Though, sadly, it's pretty universally mediocre.  A lot depends on your personal uptake.)  What seems a lot more important to me is finding a place where you can cross-pollinate with other disciplines, meet a lot of different and interesting people and, well, enjoy yourself.  The skills required for that seem to escape nerds much more often than the ability to sling code, and are essential in business interactions.  A lot of people get caught up in getting into the dozen hardest to get into schools, but most colleges will have more people smarter than you than's names you can remember, and it's not that hard to find them.";s:12:"story_author";s:10:"deltapoint";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"25";s:8:"story_id";s:6:"125317";s:10:"story_text";s:175:"I am a Junior in high school and am wondering which college would be the best for an aspiring start up entrepreneur.

This article raises the question: &#x27;where do our ideas about what programming languages should be like come from?&#x27;<p>The genesis of functional programming is obvious from its name - it is based on the mathematical concept of functions, and languages which are described as &#x27;functional&#x27; try to remain close to the ideal of emulating mathematical functions, such that concepts which work in mathematics can be applied in computer programming.  There are limits, of course - we need to interact with the world (state) and we have limits on the kinds of things that we can feasibly compute which do not exist in abstract mathematics, but the general principle holds.<p>Object-oriented programming does involve the assumption that we have a system which can be described as a set of objects interacting with each other, which can respond to requests from the user&#x27;s program.  The OP is arguing that this forces the programmer to see the <i>world</i> as a set of objects interacting with each other, or to <i>objectify</i> the world or things in it, in a manner that feminists have long seen as problematic (I don&#x27;t personally see it as problematic per se, but this is not about me).  The OP then suggests that a feminist programming language would offer a different paradigm of non-object-oriented programming.<p>I can think of a few critiques, of varying quality:<p>- There&#x27;s a difference between object-oriented programming (how to structure a computer program) and object-oriented analysis and design (how to decompose the world into objects in order to represent the world within a computer program).  The two tend to go together, but do not have to, and it is perfectly possible to program in an object-oriented manner without objectifying real-world things, e.g. people.  The &#x27;Person&#x27; object is a very common example in texts teaching people about object-oriented design, but is quite uncommon in real-world programming.<p>- I can, in a certain light, see how feminism and object-oriented analysis might be in tension.  I am less clear on how functional programming and feminism might be in tension, but would very much like to know.<p>- I am not sure that calling this language &#x27;feminist&#x27; is necessarily a good idea, since one could of course find it to be an excellent programming language without sharing any of the tenets of feminism, and the label actually obscures a lot more than it reveals in this context.  It&#x27;s certainly going to lead to a lower-quality HN thread than if this were a discussion purely about novel programming paradigms.<p>- Of course, one may simply disagree that there&#x27;s anything particularly wrong with objectification, but at this point we&#x27;re no longer talking about programming languages.<p>On the other side, this might turn out to be really interesting!  We&#x27;re nowhere near having discovered all of the possible paradigms that might underpin a programming language, and new ideas should be welcomed.  The only way to know if a feminist programming language is a good idea is for someone to create one and demonstrate how it can be used.  On longer time horizons, many of our current assumptions about how programming works may have to be discarded - the von Neumann architecture and the idea of deterministic, predictable results from computation may prove impossible to scale for certain requirements, so we might have to embrace programming languages that deal better with contradictions and the inability to &#x27;cleanly&#x27; categorise things.  If feminism&#x27;s outsider status makes it easier for feminists to think heretical thoughts about computation then perhaps we shouldn&#x27;t be surprised if feminists are a good source of ideas about these things.  (Nor, of course, should we pigeonhole feminists or women in general as purely contradictory thinkers, valuable only insofar as they challenge established paradigms!)<p>EDIT: formatting";s:12:"story_author";s:7:"jawngee";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"23";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"6893756";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:10;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"128";s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"scrollaway";s:10:"comment_id";s:8:"10346521";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:163:"I didn&#x27;t know Riot kept an engineering blog.

And they only put up banners asking for money when they need it, not all the time. So both variables in coming up with the "$.00124/visitor" estimate are incorrect.<p>2) Tax deduction does not make something cost-free.  For most people, a donation saves them nothing (since they use the standard deduction) but even for those who itemize, it only saves them the tax they would have paid on that income, not the income itself.<p>3) Tipping doesn't have to create price uncertainty.  As someone who has tried the donation model, it's clear that if you set the price of a donation (such as placing a banner that says "Give $5 now"), that's the exact amount that 90% of people will donate.   So in essence, you <i>do</i> get to influence what the perceived value of your site is worth.<p>4) The article claims that in order to orgs like NPR to succeed on the donation model, they have to have federal grants and corporate sponsorship, etc.  But this argument ignores the low barrier to entry (and low cost) of online content; it's not a valid comparison.<p>5) The article also mentions that those orgs can succeed because they offer physical goods and imply scarcity, but there's no reason that a donation-accepting site could do those as well.";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"andrewmayne";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"16";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"1206955";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:12;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"125";s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"daveloyall";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"8658482";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1996:"TIL that some programmers have to be taught what others learned first hand by encapsulating IPX packets inside TCP&#x2F;IP[1] packets inside PPP packets modulated over the POTS network.<p>(Not Kali, the OTHER one. :)  )<p>Oh, and there used to be different types of game engines.

From Alice&#x27;s point of view, the visual of Alice&#x27;s weapon fire striking Bob&#x27;s ship is rendered on her machine based on her machine&#x27;s understanding of the location of his ship.  But the AUDIO of weapon impact is &quot;rendered&quot; on Bob&#x27;s end.  So if you see impact, it means nothing--but if you hear impact, you know that 1) your fire collided with Bob&#x27;s ship on his end and 2) it happened approx. n&#x2F;2 seconds ago.<p>This resulted in a kind of meta-game wherein the lagscape was just part of the terrain.  There was a &#x27;general relativity&#x27; component to it: since neither side was master or slave... No point of view was privileged[2].  Alice had to keep two gamestates in mind at all times, the local to protect her hitpoints, and the remote to reduce his hitpoints.<p>In my opinion, both the &quot;sound&#x2F;visual disconnect&quot; and the &quot;no privileged POV&quot; were necessary ingredients in order for the lag to be &quot;part of the landscape&quot;--ie, fair and fun.<p>[1]: <i>Wait, did we already use UDP at that point?

I would love to have a mentor, but I think that I"m going to branch out on my own to find them, instead of drowning in the crowd at Start-up school to exchange three words with  Jessica or Paul.  Instead, I've been considering volunteering at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View to hang out with some elder geeks.  The Computer History Museum has a bunch of volunteer hardware/software hackers who restore vintage main-frames.  These are all really smart hackers who have spent decades in the tech business, and they are spending time in retirement doing geek stuff, because they love it.  These are the kind of people that I want to spend time with.<p>My team and I just moved to Silicon Valley this past year, and we're setting up out entire lives around the idea of having a series of start-ups.  We've driven a combined total of 12 thousand miles to get here.  We're set up financially so we can afford to iterate through start-up ideas without breaking the bank.  We have a great space to work in, and we're meeting a lot of cool people.  I actually talked with a man a few weeks ago who knew William Shockley of Shockley Semiconductor fame.  <p>Yeah, It's been a hard road just to get to Silicon Valley.  I'm sad that I didn't get in to the startup school.  But, I'm sure that I'm going to get a lot more rejections throughout my career as an entrepreneur.  If I wanted something easy, I'd choose a different career.   I'm doing this because I enjoy the challenge.  I'm doing this because I love technology.  I'm doing this because I love the game, and I'm in it for the long haul.

I didn't see an easily-accessible feedback link (note to other startup founders: include this), so I'll post my feedback here:<p>1. Congratulations.  In two days, you have managed to create a community more fucked up than YouTube.<p>2. I started watching <i>because</i> of the outrageous stuff other viewers were doing.  When you go to curb the abuse, be aware of this.  Many of your viewers may be watching only because folks are doing stupid stuff like ordering pizza and making yCombinator pay for it.  Lose the hassles and you may lose the audience.<p>3. Reality TV shows succeed because they're <i>unreal</i>.  TV execs hype up and dramatize all sorts of conflict, because that's what gets viewers to tune in.  Nobody wants to see an ordinary person's life, because it's <i>boring</i>.<p>4. Who do you want to be - Anna Nicole Smith or Paris Hilton.  Your success in attracting viewers is proportional to how trashy you are willing to become.  Anna Nicole Smith and Paris Hilton remain media darlings because we can look at them and think "Wow, look how pathetic they are."  It makes us feel good about ourselves.  Unless you are similarly pathetic, people will not want to look at you.  Respectable people like Tim Berners Lee or Steve Wozniak seldom end up on the news.<p>5. If you <i>are</i> respectable and still choose to go on reality TV, you're setting yourself up to be torn down.  The justin.tv tagline is accurate: "An exercise in narcissism".  Narcissism is going to prompt abuse.  People think that since you've set yourself up on a pedestal, you've given them an opening to tear you down.<p>6. I initially had logged in watch the yCombinator dinner.  That proved impractical because of the technology: the audio quality was shitty, the video would randomly drop out, and you couldn't really see anything anyway.  Part of the problem for attracting a decent community is there's nothing for <i>decent</i> people to do.  That leaves it as a festival for troublemakers.<p>7. Have you guys not read Shirky?

Everything starts off at a dollar, but it's fully customizable.<p>Having tinkered with the Flickr API, I don't think this would be hard to engineer. And I think there is an easy revenue model (a cut of sales), a low barrier to entry for users, and a large long tail to make money off of.<p>So anyways, that's it.
