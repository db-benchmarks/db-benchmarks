interests), there is absolutely no need to do that when you're small. It's just one more expense to think about.<p>If you don't know enough to choose one now (which is totally fine!) start with Google Analytics.

I may even understand that they need someone else, but personally that has left me with few options and in a bit of a depressed state! For my wife, this was such a huge decision (to join a startup and move to another country), and it was just awkward to convince her first, and give her the news.<p>I am not being very articulate about why this sucks  but any help&#x2F;advice would be awesome. I have a masters in CS, a failed startup and 6 yrs of management consulting behind me.<p>Edit: Thank you. Thank you for the wonderful support and advice. I called my wife and showed her this thread! We are going through every word. We are very touched by the amount of concern and positivity here!

I apologize ahead of time for my brutal honesty.<p>You need to consider the possibility that you're not as competent as you believe yourself to be.  Dunning-Kruger[0] is real, and your post doesn't demonstrate the self-awareness the best developers seem to possess.<p>Your writing is sprinkled with emoticons and rife with reduplicated punctuation, both of which (especially the exclamation points) are common signs of immaturity.  Reading this diatribe--and assuming your 50 emails were written similarly--I am forced to accept one of two conclusions: either you're not aware that your writing is unprofessional, or you're aware that it's unprofessional and unconcerned.  Either option does not reflect well on you.  To put it bluntly, if I received an email from you in this style, I would archive it without response, assuming it was from someone who lacked the requisite introspective capability I expect from the people I want to work with.<p>I found it particularly telling that you claim that all five of your phone screens went "very well" but marveled that only three companies tried to set up an onsite interview with you.  Unless both the two companies that stopped at the phone screen simultaneously filled the position immediately after your phone screen, you really need to recognize that at least those two phone screens did not go well.  I do interviews at a large Internet company, and one of my goals--one of the goals that I've been trained to seek--is to ensure that the candidate, no matter how bad, walks away from the interview feeling good about himself/herself and the company.  If you're doing really poorly in an interview, I'll toss you some easier questions than I normally give, because I have all the information I need, and I don't want you to have a negative experience with my company.  You may have felt good about the phone screens, but the most likely explanation for the two companies that didn't bring you onsite is that you didn't actually do well enough to justify additional interviews.  These people <i>want</i> to hire someone, and if you were someone they wanted to hire, they certainly <i>would</i> have continued to interview you.<p>I think your experiment was less valid than you think it was because you're less competent than you think you are.<p>EDIT: I should add that whatever the case, whether I'm right or wrong about you, the best response to the situation you're in is to seek to improve yourself, not to embark on a quixotic venture to change others.  Read CS theory books, create and modify open source projects, solve fun programming puzzles: sharpen your skills and--no matter what your level of competency--your prospects will improve.<p>[0] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"up_and_up";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"61";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3351699";s:10:"story_text";s:4263:"TL;DR version: When developer talent sends you an email, you fail to reply!!!<p>==========<p>Full Version:<p>To all the startups and companies whining about lack of developer talent, I call your bluff.<p>I ran a little experiment over the last 60 days.

Subject: Shark Tank on ABC<p>Hello,<p>My name is TrXXX and I'm contacting you from Mark Burnett Productions and ABC regarding a new show called Shark Tank.  See the trailer here: <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/sharktank/index?pn=index" rel="nofollow">http://abc.go.com/primetime/sharktank/index?pn=index</a><p>It's incredibly hard to get a small business loan from a bank right now.  This show provides the opportunity for a smart entrepreneur or inventor to pitch a product/idea or established business to a group of billionaire investors.  We are looking specifically for a up and coming fashion designer, someone who has a line but wants to expand their business.<p>The premise of Shark Tank is simple: you would approach a panel of billionaire investors (see list below) to explain how much money you would need and how much stake they would receive in turn, and get your company, project or invention more capital to either get started or expand the business.  The panel invests their own money if they decide to go with your proposal, and the outcome could be an amazing opportunity.<p>If you are interested in being on this show or have an email list you can circulate this announcement to,  please do so.  We are trying to extend this opportunity to as many people as possible.<p>Directions: each interested person should email me directly (XXX@gmail.com) with the following information:<p>Name
Occupation
Description of Business/Invention (non-confidential)
Phone number
Email
Photo<p>Once I receive this, I will send an email that you need to reply to.  From there, you can receive an application.  Don't wait, we are filming this show in July and are screening applicants now.<p>Panel of Investors:<p>Robert Herjavec (Tech Genius)

My daughter was working at that time with one of the network affiliates in Phoenix, and she knew how upset I was about this whole thing. So she put me in contact with their consumer reporter, who does the consumer complaints and that sort of thing. He came out to my house and interviewed me for about 45 minutes.

So in this case, coffeescript was definitely being used because it was easier for them as traditional programmers.<p>Earlier this week, I spent a couple days and finally went through and ported everything over to CS.<p>In my experience of having manually written a complicated client-side app in js, then manually ported it to coffeescript, I really just don't like CS.<p>I'm used to Python. Indentation there is natural. Its idiomatic to what Python is. But its not in javascript. Granted, indentation should always be used in js for readability, but brackets really are needed to denote code blocks.<p>Another complaint I have against CS is that it tries to do so much stuff "as if by magic" that I was never 100% what my code was going to output. I just find:<p><pre><code>    abc (arg,arg2) -&#62;
</code></pre>
to be really fucking confusing. Not to mention adding in the fat arrow, or 'do' if you need to wrap something in a closure.<p>I'm probably old school, but when I write code I need to know explicitly what it will do. I know what 'this' will refer to based on how I write. Same for closures.<p>Lots of times, my original code was just as concise as the coffeescript version, and a hell of a lot more concise than what CS rendered out.<p>So everyone has their opinions, likes and dislikes. For me, I'm gonna stick with native javascript for the time being.";s:12:"story_author";s:8:"bemaniac";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"18";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3838274";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:14;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"641";s:14:"comment_author";s:12:"brianbreslin";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"5977276";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"27";s:12:"comment_text";s:204:"As someone who went to UVA, this isn&#x27;t entirely surprising, but it still saddens me.

This is the same Charles Murray who was co-author of the even more controversial 1994 book The Bell Curve, which argued not only that I.Q. was genetically determined but that it amounted to destiny ..."</i><p>The sad thing is, this statement is sometimes true (but not as much as Murry would suggest). When I was young, down the street lived a big kid, Kenny was his name. He was never really allowed out like the other kids. But I do remember when I visited his house once he had the largest box of cars I'd ever seen. I remember asking my mum if he could come out to my house some time and possibly bring some toys. Only to be promptly told no. Why? Well he's different and has trouble learning and goes to a special school.<p>But why?<p>Surely he could take a book and learn as much as he wanted? No was the reply... Never.  I remember balling my eyes out hearing this as I couldn't understand why he couldn't just pick a book up and learn as I was at school. Of course this didn't stop Kenny playing Basketball for Australia or numerous other achievements. The reason why Murray is wrong is this is an extreme. Not everyone has the intellectual disability that 
crippled Kenny's ability to learn and therefore if they want to learn new things all the stops should be pulled out if they show the inclination. The ability to learn is a form of emancipation.<p><i>"... the others are incapable of doing college-level work  and those who do should study a curriculum heavy on the great books, so they can become moral and ethical mandarins and wisely run the country for the rest of us. ..."</i><p>China has this sort of approach and I'll give you an example of the kind of screwed up problems it can cause. Australia has a large quantity of super fine Merino wool. It's the material that all the best suits are woven from and has some unique properties that make it ideal for high-end garments. But it's expensive. So the Chinese decided that investment was one way to go ~ <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1664831.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1664831.htm</a> So they invested some money in an existing Merino Sheep-Station with the intention of growing the wool then shipping the clipped wool to China thus saving money. From clip to yarn would be all Chinese. But running a farm tested their approach to tackling things - their bias for groups of "elites" who are primarily tertiary educated instructing a greater mass of ill-educated.<p>Running a farm is difficult anywhere. Not having any local expertise or understanding of the local conditions as well as a group of people that could be trained or seek training on the latest techniques but could also put this training into practice turned out to be fatal. The farm failed.  The highly educated couldn't translate their theory into practice. The lesser educated couldn't be show how.<p>What was missing was the broad spectrum of skills and intelligence, something what we class as tradesman or technicians. We severely underestimate the quality and expertise of our tradespeople and technicians.";s:12:"story_author";s:8:"bootload";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"17";s:8:"story_id";s:6:"350980";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:17;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"96";s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"shubhamjain";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"5926358";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"8";s:12:"comment_text";s:1340:"You won&#x27;t believe how bad the ground situation until you see yourself happening.

Dunning-Kruger[0] is real, and your post doesn't demonstrate the self-awareness the best developers seem to possess.<p>Your writing is sprinkled with emoticons and rife with reduplicated punctuation, both of which (especially the exclamation points) are common signs of immaturity.  Reading this diatribe--and assuming your 50 emails were written similarly--I am forced to accept one of two conclusions: either you're not aware that your writing is unprofessional, or you're aware that it's unprofessional and unconcerned.  Either option does not reflect well on you.  To put it bluntly, if I received an email from you in this style, I would archive it without response, assuming it was from someone who lacked the requisite introspective capability I expect from the people I want to work with.<p>I found it particularly telling that you claim that all five of your phone screens went "very well" but marveled that only three companies tried to set up an onsite interview with you.  Unless both the two companies that stopped at the phone screen simultaneously filled the position immediately after your phone screen, you really need to recognize that at least those two phone screens did not go well.  I do interviews at a large Internet company, and one of my goals--one of the goals that I've been trained to seek--is to ensure that the candidate, no matter how bad, walks away from the interview feeling good about himself/herself and the company.  If you're doing really poorly in an interview, I'll toss you some easier questions than I normally give, because I have all the information I need, and I don't want you to have a negative experience with my company.  You may have felt good about the phone screens, but the most likely explanation for the two companies that didn't bring you onsite is that you didn't actually do well enough to justify additional interviews.  These people <i>want</i> to hire someone, and if you were someone they wanted to hire, they certainly <i>would</i> have continued to interview you.<p>I think your experiment was less valid than you think it was because you're less competent than you think you are.<p>EDIT: I should add that whatever the case, whether I'm right or wrong about you, the best response to the situation you're in is to seek to improve yourself, not to embark on a quixotic venture to change others.  Read CS theory books, create and modify open source projects, solve fun programming puzzles: sharpen your skills and--no matter what your level of competency--your prospects will improve.<p>[0] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"up_and_up";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"61";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3351699";s:10:"story_text";s:4263:"TL;DR version: When developer talent sends you an email, you fail to reply!!!<p>==========<p>Full Version:<p>To all the startups and companies whining about lack of developer talent, I call your bluff.<p>I ran a little experiment over the last 60 days.

The thing about a startup is, there are five or ten of you. This isn't just another job. You generally don't just come in at 9, work work work, maybe take lunch with your teammates, and trip it out at 5. You don't just attend the company Christmas party.

When someone quits at a startup, you spend some serious time looking around to make sure there's nothing scaring them off, because every individual counts a great deal.<p>In short, culture is critical, and even as a married father of two, signing up for a startup is signing up for a culture and a tight-knit group of friends as much as it is signing up for a job.";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"up_and_up";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"61";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3351699";s:10:"story_text";s:4263:"TL;DR version: When developer talent sends you an email, you fail to reply!!!<p>==========<p>Full Version:<p>To all the startups and companies whining about lack of developer talent, I call your bluff.<p>I ran a little experiment over the last 60 days. I sent emails to ~50 different companies (some well-known, others unknown) that were looking for "Sr. Developers", particularly Ruby devs, as found on the major developer job sites (stackoverflow, Dice, Indeed, 37signals etc). I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting. I also picked companies that most closely matched my skillset. In my email I introduced myself and included my resume. Here is how I am represented in the email (paraphrased from actual text, ):<p>Given: X &#62; 7 &#38; Y &#62; 4,<p>"Sr. Level Developer, with X years exp. Y years of prof exp with Ruby. Main expertise is in Ruby, API's, MySQL and a bunch of other stuff. Previously worked for 'ABC' startup ($X Millions angel backed) for two years and helped build out the entire app/platform etc. Later served as CTO for several side projects. I attended Top Tier University , ...  blah blah blah"<p>More stats:<p>Salary expectations: $115K<p>Areas of interest: API's, Analytics, SaaS, Telephony, Machine learning ....<p>Ability to relocate: Open to idea, can't right away<p>Telecommuter?: Pretty please<p>Snark level: Not nearly as high as this post ;)<p>Likeability: Very high<p>So out of ~50 companies that I tried contacting what was the result?<p>10/50 - sent me a reply email of some sort (confirmation, autoreply, whatever)<p>7/50 - tried to setup a phone screen<p>5/50 - actually completed the phone screen (with all phones screens going very well, I might add)<p>3/50 - tried to setup a technical interview<p>0/50 - actually completed a technical interview<p>0/50 - made offer!<p>From my 60 day simple experiment, I argue......<p>The top 5 reasons you are (probably) not hiring:<p>1. You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc". If you think of "Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting";}i:4;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:14:"comment_author";s:9:"JCordeiro";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3946441";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"26";s:12:"comment_text";s:20:"This is lame by ABC.";s:12:"story_author";s:10:"seanmccann";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"29";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3946008";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:5;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:14:"comment_author";s:9:"ReadyNSet";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1963094";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"33";s:12:"comment_text";s:236:"Launched an iPhone app for young ones to learn alphabet by popping balloons :)<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/popn-learn-abc/id400222528?mt=8" rel="nofollow">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/popn-learn-abc/id400222528?mt...</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"commiebob";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"62";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"1962465";s:10:"story_text";s:179:"I know there were a lot of people working on launching an app by the end of November.<p>Well, it's December 2, so I figure it's time for some show and tell.<p>How did everyone do?";}i:6;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"34";s:14:"comment_author";s:7:"azat_co";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3946599";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"20";s:12:"comment_text";s:303:"Well it's a Shark Tank, right?

Subject: Shark Tank on ABC<p>Hello,<p>My name is TrXXX and I'm contacting you from Mark Burnett Productions and ABC regarding a new show called Shark Tank.  See the trailer here: <a href="http://abc.go.com/primetime/sharktank/index?pn=index" rel="nofollow">http://abc.go.com/primetime/sharktank/index?pn=index</a><p>It's incredibly hard to get a small business loan from a bank right now.  This show provides the opportunity for a smart entrepreneur or inventor to pitch a product/idea or established business to a group of billionaire investors.  We are looking specifically for a up and coming fashion designer, someone who has a line but wants to expand their business.<p>The premise of Shark Tank is simple: you would approach a panel of billionaire investors (see list below) to explain how much money you would need and how much stake they would receive in turn, and get your company, project or invention more capital to either get started or expand the business.  The panel invests their own money if they decide to go with your proposal, and the outcome could be an amazing opportunity.<p>If you are interested in being on this show or have an email list you can circulate this announcement to,  please do so.  We are trying to extend this opportunity to as many people as possible.<p>Directions: each interested person should email me directly (XXX@gmail.com) with the following information:<p>Name
Occupation
Description of Business/Invention (non-confidential)
Phone number
Email
Photo<p>Once I receive this, I will send an email that you need to reply to.  From there, you can receive an application.  Don't wait, we are filming this show in July and are screening applicants now.<p>Panel of Investors:<p>Robert Herjavec (Tech Genius)

I was playing around with loading up some comic books for an upcoming trip.  A nice directory structure of .cbr files on my computer is mangled beyond repair when turned into a flat list of files to add to a single app. The app (Cloudreaders) offers organization via tagging, but re-tagging 500 files is untenable. The iPad needs to expose itself as a USB storage device that I can drag folders onto, security sandbox be damned.<p>No background processing is disappointing for a hacker like myself. I've been building an in-browser HTML5 audio library. MP3/M4A playback works extremely well on the iPad's Safari. Until you open a "new page" or jump out of the browser. Thankfully the current song doesn't stop playing, but no Javascript events fire so the next song can't start.<p>I also do miss Flash for various reasons. Flash can extract waveform data from audio files to perform visualizations for example.<p>Battery life, blah blah blah, I need a computer I can hack and script.<p>I use Chrome and have my bookmarks synched across many computers, so Mobile Safari is a black sheep anyway.<p>I do get in the zone on my iPad when I'm reading some PDFs or comic books, watching ABC or Netflix, or playing pinball.

The accountant who essentially documented the impending collapse of Citigroup in less than 2 pages was interviewed by the SEC and then never heard from them again. Then there's this guy:<p>&#62; The congressional responses were, Thank you for your letter, and thank you for your interest.

My daughter was working at that time with one of the network affiliates in Phoenix, and she knew how upset I was about this whole thing. So she put me in contact with their consumer reporter, who does the consumer complaints and that sort of thing. He came out to my house and interviewed me for about 45 minutes. And I gave him documentation, and tried to as best I could to explain the situation to someone that was basically ignorant of the mortgage industry. Never heard another word. <p>&#62; During the mortgage meltdown, [Fox News host] Bill OReilly was having a temper tantrum on his show where he was going off about, Why didnt I hear about this?

I was a newbie to coffeescript beforehand, so to hit deadlines wrote everything in vanilla js to save time and get work done.

Indentation there is natural. Its idiomatic to what Python is. But its not in javascript. Granted, indentation should always be used in js for readability, but brackets really are needed to denote code blocks.<p>Another complaint I have against CS is that it tries to do so much stuff "as if by magic" that I was never 100% what my code was going to output. I just find:<p><pre><code>    abc (arg,arg2) -&#62;

to be really fucking confusing.

I know what 'this' will refer to based on how I write. Same for closures.<p>Lots of times, my original code was just as concise as the coffeescript version, and a hell of a lot more concise than what CS rendered out.<p>So everyone has their opinions, likes and dislikes.

This is the same Charles Murray who was co-author of the even more controversial 1994 book The Bell Curve, which argued not only that I.Q. was genetically determined but that it amounted to destiny ..."</i><p>The sad thing is, this statement is sometimes true (but not as much as Murry would suggest). When I was young, down the street lived a big kid, Kenny was his name. He was never really allowed out like the other kids. But I do remember when I visited his house once he had the largest box of cars I'd ever seen. I remember asking my mum if he could come out to my house some time and possibly bring some toys. Only to be promptly told no. Why? Well he's different and has trouble learning and goes to a special school.<p>But why?<p>Surely he could take a book and learn as much as he wanted? No was the reply... Never.  I remember balling my eyes out hearing this as I couldn't understand why he couldn't just pick a book up and learn as I was at school. Of course this didn't stop Kenny playing Basketball for Australia or numerous other achievements. The reason why Murray is wrong is this is an extreme. Not everyone has the intellectual disability that 
crippled Kenny's ability to learn and therefore if they want to learn new things all the stops should be pulled out if they show the inclination. The ability to learn is a form of emancipation.<p><i>"... the others are incapable of doing college-level work  and those who do should study a curriculum heavy on the great books, so they can become moral and ethical mandarins and wisely run the country for the rest of us. ..."</i><p>China has this sort of approach and I'll give you an example of the kind of screwed up problems it can cause. Australia has a large quantity of super fine Merino wool. It's the material that all the best suits are woven from and has some unique properties that make it ideal for high-end garments. But it's expensive. So the Chinese decided that investment was one way to go ~ <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1664831.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.net.au/landline/content/2006/s1664831.htm</a> So they invested some money in an existing Merino Sheep-Station with the intention of growing the wool then shipping the clipped wool to China thus saving money. From clip to yarn would be all Chinese. But running a farm tested their approach to tackling things - their bias for groups of "elites" who are primarily tertiary educated instructing a greater mass of ill-educated.<p>Running a farm is difficult anywhere. Not having any local expertise or understanding of the local conditions as well as a group of people that could be trained or seek training on the latest techniques but could also put this training into practice turned out to be fatal. The farm failed.  The highly educated couldn't translate their theory into practice. The lesser educated couldn't be show how.<p>What was missing was the broad spectrum of skills and intelligence, something what we class as tradesman or technicians.

So James Cameron, Larry Page, and Eric Schmidt are starting a venture to mine asteroids. James Cameron recently dove to the deepest parts of the ocean in his own submersible. The launch of Elon Musk &#38; SpaceX's Falcon 9 mission to the ISS is just around the corner. I know I've read about other famous people launching wildly ambitious projects, but I can't remember them at the moment.<p>This is just mind blowing to me. These are endeavors normally left to nation states. There's something buried in here that I find fascinating.<p>In the past, when these endeavors were carried out by nation states, all the baggage of bureaucracy was along for the ride. Fast forward to today, and you have individuals with the imagination and the means to dream big. It's possible to undertake something insane -- like mining asteroids -- on your own.<p>I'm left thinking about the way that Steve Jobs ran Apple. I don't intend to steal credit from all the hard work of the people at Apple, but Steve Jobs ran Apple in a way that stands in contrast to many other companies.

By sketchy, I mean that they may offend someone of a particular set, but are otherwise (in my opinion) brilliant executions that I'm proud of. I've never done anything illegal, and I like to think I have a solid base of ethics.<p>For example, when I was around 17, I picked up a trademarked domain for a popular music group from expiry (they didn't own it prior, was just a holding page for non-related topic). I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for "bling" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate. I offered email service, networked with other hip hop sites, and made about $100k from adsense before I was graciously C&#38;D'd and handed the name over.<p>Most recently I cofounded a project that was covered on the sites of TIME, CBS, Business Insider, Gawker, and pending an ABC News article. It made the front page of HN as well (thanks guys). That site was Price Of Weed, where we crowdsource and share information about the price people pay for marijuana. Possession is still illegal in most of the world; its easy to assume I'm some sort of stoner/drug pusher because I'm associated with this project, but in reality I don't smoke much at all.<p>Now I'm a biz guy and probably won't be applying to jobs at big corporations. I'd really like to work for a startup, which I believe would be less judgmental and more accepting of my project history. If you were me, would you stick these projects on your resume?

If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment. Some of that equipment is located onboard a fire truck or an ambulance. Most of that equipment is usually found inside the operating room of your local hospital.

I apologize ahead of time for my brutal honesty.<p>You need to consider the possibility that you're not as competent as you believe yourself to be.  Dunning-Kruger[0] is real, and your post doesn't demonstrate the self-awareness the best developers seem to possess.<p>Your writing is sprinkled with emoticons and rife with reduplicated punctuation, both of which (especially the exclamation points) are common signs of immaturity.  Reading this diatribe--and assuming your 50 emails were written similarly--I am forced to accept one of two conclusions: either you're not aware that your writing is unprofessional, or you're aware that it's unprofessional and unconcerned.  Either option does not reflect well on you.  To put it bluntly, if I received an email from you in this style, I would archive it without response, assuming it was from someone who lacked the requisite introspective capability I expect from the people I want to work with.<p>I found it particularly telling that you claim that all five of your phone screens went "very well" but marveled that only three companies tried to set up an onsite interview with you.  Unless both the two companies that stopped at the phone screen simultaneously filled the position immediately after your phone screen, you really need to recognize that at least those two phone screens did not go well.  I do interviews at a large Internet company, and one of my goals--one of the goals that I've been trained to seek--is to ensure that the candidate, no matter how bad, walks away from the interview feeling good about himself/herself and the company.  If you're doing really poorly in an interview, I'll toss you some easier questions than I normally give, because I have all the information I need, and I don't want you to have a negative experience with my company.  You may have felt good about the phone screens, but the most likely explanation for the two companies that didn't bring you onsite is that you didn't actually do well enough to justify additional interviews.  These people <i>want</i> to hire someone, and if you were someone they wanted to hire, they certainly <i>would</i> have continued to interview you.<p>I think your experiment was less valid than you think it was because you're less competent than you think you are.<p>EDIT: I should add that whatever the case, whether I'm right or wrong about you, the best response to the situation you're in is to seek to improve yourself, not to embark on a quixotic venture to change others.  Read CS theory books, create and modify open source projects, solve fun programming puzzles: sharpen your skills and--no matter what your level of competency--your prospects will improve.<p>[0] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"up_and_up";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"61";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3351699";s:10:"story_text";s:4263:"TL;DR version: When developer talent sends you an email, you fail to reply!!!<p>==========<p>Full Version:<p>To all the startups and companies whining about lack of developer talent, I call your bluff.<p>I ran a little experiment over the last 60 days. I sent emails to ~50 different companies (some well-known, others unknown) that were looking for "Sr. Developers", particularly Ruby devs, as found on the major developer job sites (stackoverflow, Dice, Indeed, 37signals etc). I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting. I also picked companies that most closely matched my skillset. In my email I introduced myself and included my resume. Here is how I am represented in the email (paraphrased from actual text, ):<p>Given: X &#62; 7 &#38; Y &#62; 4,<p>"Sr. Level Developer, with X years exp. Y years of prof exp with Ruby. Main expertise is in Ruby, API's, MySQL and a bunch of other stuff. Previously worked for 'ABC' startup ($X Millions angel backed) for two years and helped build out the entire app/platform etc. Later served as CTO for several side projects. I attended Top Tier University , ...  blah blah blah"<p>More stats:<p>Salary expectations: $115K<p>Areas of interest: API's, Analytics, SaaS, Telephony, Machine learning ....<p>Ability to relocate: Open to idea, can't right away<p>Telecommuter?: Pretty please<p>Snark level: Not nearly as high as this post ;)<p>Likeability: Very high<p>So out of ~50 companies that I tried contacting what was the result?<p>10/50 - sent me a reply email of some sort (confirmation, autoreply, whatever)<p>7/50 - tried to setup a phone screen<p>5/50 - actually completed the phone screen (with all phones screens going very well, I might add)<p>3/50 - tried to setup a technical interview<p>0/50 - actually completed a technical interview<p>0/50 - made offer!<p>From my 60 day simple experiment, I argue......<p>The top 5 reasons you are (probably) not hiring:<p>1. You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc". If you think of "Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting";}i:10;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"96";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"jdnier";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"5619012";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1684:"I fed it a favorite regex...

Really. I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on.

The accountant who essentially documented the impending collapse of Citigroup in less than 2 pages was interviewed by the SEC and then never heard from them again. Then there's this guy:<p>&#62; The congressional responses were, Thank you for your letter, and thank you for your interest. And, Well look into this, basically.<p>&#62; I also wrote letters to just about every television journalist, and network journalist that I could get my hands on. Sent as e-mail with attachments and never received any response. [I wrote to] CNN and Fox News. ABC News, NBC News, CBS. My daughter was working at that time with one of the network affiliates in Phoenix, and she knew how upset I was about this whole thing. So she put me in contact with their consumer reporter, who does the consumer complaints and that sort of thing. He came out to my house and interviewed me for about 45 minutes. And I gave him documentation, and tried to as best I could to explain the situation to someone that was basically ignorant of the mortgage industry. Never heard another word. <p>&#62; During the mortgage meltdown, [Fox News host] Bill OReilly was having a temper tantrum on his show where he was going off about, Why didnt I hear about this? Why didnt somebody tell me about all this that was going on? And I almost threw my shoe through the television set. Ask my wife  I was screaming and yelling, I did try to let you know. Cause he had been one of the ones that I had sent e-mails and attachments with all of this stuff. <p>What the hell are these people supposed to do?

I don't think many people would argue with that, it's awesome. In fact, we use it at Zapier for pretty much everything (basic funnels, A/B testing, retention, engagement, etc...) and we haven't even reached our full potential with it yet. But I still have some pretty fundamental beefs with the state of analytics software in general.<p>About the article, the problem stems from the fact that proper analytics is hard and is (arguably) getting harder with more advanced packages.Shouldn't it be going in the opposite direction?<p>It is a lot easier to track discrete downloads or pageviews than some other, more insightful metric, so people will naturally gravitate to the cheaper metrics. Until this is reversed, bullshit metrics will reign.<p>Anyways, my beefs:<p><i>First</i>: how do you decide what data to send into the package?<p>The more data you send, the better (sure), but at a certain point you are just duplicating your internal datastore, so that is too much, right? But not enough and you'll miss a chance to understand a phenomena that you didn't predict seeing (isn't that the point?). After you decide, then you write a crapton of code to send it all (what about backfilling data when you want to track something new?).<p><i>Second</i>: once you are collecting the data, how do you know what metrics to actively track?<p>This is definitely existential, but it's back to the core problem: doing analytics properly is <i>hard</i>. Why couldn't the software let me define some properties about the <i>type</i> of app I am running and suggest some strategies (you have a subscription SaaS app? Try tracking paid plan retention, signup funnels, etc...). Maybe it could go even further with <i>reverse</i> funnels, as in: what events are the most important and work backwards. I could see some automation and discovery possibilities there.<p><i>Third</i>: do I really have to dig around trying to find something useful?<p>All the data is there, the software should <i>tell</i> me what is useful or interesting. It's definitely a hard problem, but I would throw money at software that could send me this email: "<i>Looks like users who experienced event "ABC" also performed your highest priority event "Signup" at a 13% higher rate. This observation is 99% confident.</i>" Of course, you'd need to investigate a littler deeper to see if that isn't just a fluke or something stupidly obvious (like: people who view a page signup at a higher rate than those who don't), but at least I might learn something.<p>I know this is certainly a pipe dream as of today, but I vow to shower someone with money if they can do this.<p>In my opinion, the next generation of analytics software won't just have more bells and whistles, it will fundamentally shorten the time to some sort of real "AHA!" insight.";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"billclerico";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"18";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4933958";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}}s:8:"checksum";i:2302528540;s:10:"warmupTime";d:18144;}i:17;a:13:{s:10:"avgFastest";i:450841;s:2:"cv";d:7.61;s:3:"avg";d:460759;s:12:"cvAvgFastest";d:0.41;s:4:"cold";d:649096;s:7:"fastest";d:448236;s:7:"slowest";d:649096;s:5:"times";a:34:{i:0;d:649096;i:1;d:455898;i:2;d:449176;i:3;d:474426;i:4;d:450266;i:5;d:484197;i:6;d:456760;i:7;d:451659;i:8;d:513469;i:9;d:456028;i:10;d:448236;i:11;d:450689;i:12;d:450902;i:13;d:450540;i:14;d:450453;i:15;d:449906;i:16;d:453893;i:17;d:459128;i:18;d:449573;i:19;d:450055;i:20;d:451242;i:21;d:449953;i:22;d:448653;i:23;d:448573;i:24;d:449444;i:25;d:449937;i:26;d:454103;i:27;d:452451;i:28;d:452954;i:29;d:452012;i:30;d:448696;i:31;d:452690;i:32;d:449715;i:33;d:451041;}s:13:"originalQuery";s:94:"select * from hn_small where match('abc') order by comment_ranking asc, story_id desc limit 20";s:13:"modifiedQuery";s:231:"select * from hn_small where (match(story_text, '(?i)\Wabc\W') or match(story_author,'(?i)\Wabc\W') or match(comment_text, '(?i)\Wabc\W') or match(comment_author, '(?i)\Wabc\W')) order by comment_ranking asc, story_id desc limit 20";s:6:"result";a:20:{i:0;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"127";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"powera";s:10:"comment_id";s:8:"10350694";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:874:"OK, I have no idea how the proof works, but I think I read the abstracts well enough to do something that might qualify as pretending to pretend to know how the proof works: (please note: I&#x27;m not qualified to pretend to know how this works, I have to pretend twice to get anything that sounds like both math and English)<p>* Part 1: All chaotic systems are isomorphic to an elliptic curve [traditionally y2 = x3 + ax + b] for some extended definition of elliptic curves<p>* Part 2: A general method of constructing isomorphisms of chaotic systems to extended elliptic curves<p>* Part 3: Using the method from Part 2, construct a more understandable model of the chaotic structure of the natural numbers<p>* Part 4: Using the model constructed in part 3, construct a proof for abc<p>Hopefully if you understand any of this you can point out why I&#x27;m obviously wrong.";s:12:"story_author";s:12:"robinhouston";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:8:"10348617";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:1;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"127";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"declan";s:10:"comment_id";s:8:"10285768";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1196:"Let&#x27;s say that political polarization is in fact increasing since 1996.

If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment.

He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was &quot;Negroes&quot;), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. He made me aware of a society in which people didn&#x27;t all treat one another with decency and human compassion, unlike the only kind of society I was initially aware of from growing up where I did. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn&#x27;t shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC) affirmative action program. (To me, the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don&#x27;t.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;Afro-American&quot; or &quot;black&quot; was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, &quot;What do you want to be called, &#x27;black&#x27; or &#x27;Afro-American&#x27;?&quot; His answer was, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be called Henry.&quot; Henry&#x27;s answer to my classmate&#x27;s innocent question really got me thinking. Why not treat all of my neighbors as individuals, one at a time?<p>And anyway I&#x27;ve seen this issue go wrong for people in other countries. Also in my childhood, in the other state I lived in growing up, I had a classmate in the early 1970s who would get on the school bus each day wearing a button that said &quot;Serb Power.&quot; I thought that was very strange, because I knew my history well enough to know that Serbia hadn&#x27;t been an independent country since Yugoslavia was formed after World War I. And, anyway, he was living in the United States and had been born here, so why was he so concerned about Serb power? We all found out during the early 1990s how crazy many people in Yugoslavia were about former historical grievances, which made that country disintegrate and killed many innocent people born long after the grievances should have been forgotten.<p>Most reporting to the federal government about &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; is based on the U.S. Census bureau definitions for ethnicity and race categories, which in turn are based on regulations from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which were announced on 30 October 1997<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitehouse.gov&#x2F;omb&#x2F;fedreg_1997standards</a><p>to take effect no later than 1 January 2003 for data collection by all federal agencies. You can look up the detailed category definitions on the website of the United States Bureau of the Census. As the Census Bureau itself notes,<p>&quot;U.S. federal government agencies must adhere to standards issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in October 1997, which specify that  race  and Hispanic origin (also known as ethnicity) are two separate and distinct concepts.  These standards generally reflect a social definition of race and ethnicity recognized in this country and they do not conform to any biological, anthropological, or genetic criteria.  The standards include five minimum categories for data on race:  &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native,&quot; &quot;Asian,&quot; &quot;Black or African American,&quot; &quot;Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,&quot; and &quot;White.&quot;  There are two minimum categories for data on ethnicity:  &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; and &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino.&quot;  The concept of race reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify.  Persons who report themselves as Hispanic can be of any race and are identified as such in our data tables.&quot;<p><a href="https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.census.gov&#x2F;faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191</a><p>It&#x27;s politics all the way down.

You prove your theorems more or less by typing out the proofs and the system mechanically verifies that each step in your proof is sound. I&#x27;ve used Coq and I&#x27;ll be honest. This is unquestionably a solid way to prove things about your program but it is too much of pain to expect this to have significant adoption in the &quot;real&quot; world.<p>In the hardware world, there&#x27;s been a lot of progress in automated verification thanks to modern model checkers [1,2] (which incidentally build on modern SAT, and in some cases SMT, solvers [3-6]). The nice thing about model checkers is that you just specify the property you want proven and let the verifier crunch away and it will (hopefully) come up with a proof or a counterexample. This has been successful enough that there are companies like JASPER and OneSpin which make money by selling hardware companies formal verification tools.<p>I worked with JASPER&#x27;s tools in the recent-ish past and one of the big things they seem to have done is make the tool much more usable. With the JASPER tool, it was much less of a pain to configure the model checker, abstract away parts of the design, keep track of the properties specified and proven, examine counter example traces and so forth than I was expecting. A lot of this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t get done in academic tools like ABC because it doesn&#x27;t count as research. But such improvements are extremely important if you want to push adoption of formal tools in an industrial setting. And from what I can see the emphasis on usability seems to paying off for JASPER.<p>Model checking in software has been less successful because the state explosion problem is much more pronounced but there have been notable success stories like Microsoft Research&#x27;s SLAM project [7]. And I definitely think there is an opportunity here to build upon the algorithmic progress in automated verification in order to build tools that are much usable in a software setting.<p>[1] <a href="http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bradleya/ic3/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecee.colorado.edu&#x2F;~bradleya&#x2F;ic3&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/abc.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~alanmi&#x2F;abc&#x2F;abc.htm</a><p>[3] <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.princeton.edu&#x2F;~chaff&#x2F;zchaff.html</a><p>[4] <a href="http://minisat.se/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;minisat.se&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fmv.jku.at&#x2F;picosat&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href="http://z3.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;z3.codeplex.com&#x2F;</a><p>[7] <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;projects&#x2F;slam&#x2F;</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"dllthomas";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7618406";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:13;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"356";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"suprgeek";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"7485127";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:684:"This is tyranny sneaking up on us one &quot;No-XYZ list&quot; at a time.<p>They can put you on it for any reason (lets say you oppose one of the Govt. policies - Drone Bombings for example), you will be unable to find out why you are on said list or even if you are.<p>Since you cannot confirm that you are on said list you will not be able to get off it.

Really. I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on.

The majority of my students are experienced programmers, but no small number are new to programming beyond very simple stuff.   I&#x27;ve found that Python has a number of aspects that are ideal for first-time programmers:<p>- It&#x27;s dynamically typed.  Say what you want about static vs. dynamic typing, but this is one less thing that newbie programmers have to get right.  There&#x27;s no chance of an error when they say &quot;i = &#x27;abc&#x27;&quot;, if you&#x27;ve defined i to be an int.<p>- It&#x27;s interactive.  The fact that you can &quot;play&quot; with the language within the interactive shell is a huge selling point.  IPython and the IPython Notebook are easy to get working, and for people to work with.<p>- Python&#x27;s restricted command set and simple, regular syntax let you concentrate on ideas: Yes, many newbies to Python (and to programming in general) get confused by indentation, blocks, colons, and the like.  But they&#x27;re going to get confused by the syntax of nearly any language.  Python has a simpler syntax than most other languages, meaning that there&#x27;s less to learn, and less to remember.  This lets the new programmer concentrate on the ideas that they&#x27;re learning, or the implementation of what they&#x27;re doing.<p>- It&#x27;s cross platform.  The fact that people can use Python on any computer they like is a big selling point.<p>- You can easily teach object-oriented and functional-style programming.  Python is obviously object-oriented, but can also be used to introduce functional programming.  In this way, you can expose programmers not only to multiple paradigms in Python, but also in other languages.<p>- You can use it for real applications.  People are often surprised to discover that real-life applications are being written and used in this language that they&#x27;re learning, which seems so simple.<p>I&#x27;m sure that there are more reasons than these.  But let&#x27;s consider the alternatives that the article suggested:<p>- I would be hard-pressed to think of a <i>worse</i> first language than C.  You want to introduce people to the concepts of programming, which means abstractions and high-level thinking.  C forces you to think in terms of the computer and its memory, which is just the opposite.  The fact that it&#x27;s compiled to binary form, that you don&#x27;t have an interactive C shell, and pointers are just three reasons why I think that C would be a very bad choice.  Sure, everyone should learn C at some point -- although I often point out that I&#x27;m a much happier person since I moved to dynamic, high-level languages many years ago -- but if you want to teach the concepts of programming, C is going to require too much learning just to get simple things done.<p>- JavaScript has many good points for beginning programmers -- but the chief problem, in my mind, is the language&#x27;s syntax, which is far too inconsistent and forgiving&#x2F;flexible for newbies.  I think that someone coming to JavaScript from Python will have a very easy time; the mapping of data types is fairly straightforward, and even the notion of passing functions is pretty easy to get.  But the learning curve in JavaScript seems steeper to me than in Python, despite the obvious advantages of being able to work within a browser.";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"btimil";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7122163";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:17;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"70";s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"robbiet480";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"5999686";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:3795:"(latest info at bottom of comment)<p>ABC reports it was coming from Taipei, linked forum says Taipei.

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5834687";s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

In normal operation of Android, I <i>never</i> see this pool actually get low unless running the qrngtest tool, in which case qrngd just fills it right back up.<p>Looking in drivers/char/random.c though, the functions which are called in the interrupt, input, and block device paths have an inner function add_timer_randomness which calls preempt_disable().<p>As a totally non scientific test, I turned all of these functions into no-ops and recompiled. This way, we're ONLY relying on the hardware RNG.<p>There's no change in entropy available because random numbers really just aren't being used all that often.<p>But now, I'm seeing a modest increase in interactivity on the device. Certain things feel smoother, and there is less UI jank. There's no change in frequency scaling or power usage as proposed earlier. qrngtest passes just fine as well.<p>What's going on here? I'm not entirely sure. We're either all crazy, or this is tickling a subtle scheduling bug in the kernel. More investigation is needed.

I'm from Australia, so using Amazon is a pain due to manufacturer export restrictions, and the often prohibitively expensive shipping costs. So in many cases eBay is a better alternative.

The latter can actually be pretty useful in a variety of scientific, technical, and management fields, except you have to pair it with something.  Anyway, here&#x27;s my list (for reference, I&#x27;m 32, have roughly 9 years of professional experience all of it in software, and currently work on search for Google.  I have a CS degree but went to a liberal arts college and switched around between physics, philosophy, and sociology before settling on it):<p>1. Programming is a very cognitively demanding and highly rational skill.  To do it well, you to some extent need to &quot;shut down&quot; your emotional circuitry and your intuitions about how things <i>should</i> work, pay very careful attention to how things <i>do</i> work, and then retrain your instincts to take this into account.  All on a very rigorous, formal, mathematical level.  Unfortunately, if you do this without simultaneously maintaining an active social life, you risk finding yourself unable to relate to &quot;normal&quot; people.  It&#x27;s not just that programming attracts geeks, it&#x27;s that programming enough can <i>turn you into</i> a geek.  This is avoidable (some of the top minds in our field have a life outside work and are quite approachable as human beings), but it requires that you set strict limits on the time you spend hacking - which can often be hard to keep to when you hear about a 19-year-old kid who invented a peer-to-peer protocol or a 23-year-old who invented a programming language.<p>2. There&#x27;s an expiration date on your knowledge.  It&#x27;s not as drastic as some people make it out to be - it is still possible to get hired as an engineer past 40.  But pretty much  everything you learned when you first started out will be obsolete.  I&#x27;ve only been doing this since 2000 and I&#x27;ve had to reinvent myself at least three times - I started as a desktop UI dev working with Java Swing; then I learned JS and web technologies pretty deeply; then I got into unstructured data mining, clustering, and ranking algorithms; now I&#x27;m back doing UI, but for mobile web devices (which have completely different performance characteristics as desktop) in a lead role.  In fields like law or accounting you gradually learn more of a huge body of relatively static knowledge, and so your intellectual capital increases monotonically over your career.  In computing, large bodies of knowledge become completely obsolete overnight, and so you can easily have huge discontinuities in your career where you have to adapt or fade into irrelevance.<p>3. Programming is not amenable to just putting in your time and packing it away when you go home at 5.  It&#x27;s a creative profession, and creativity is subject to the whims of your brain and requires engagement and grappling with the subject.  Many programmers find it really hard to work on a set schedule - Paul Graham has a good essay called &quot;Maker&#x27;s schedule vs. Manager&#x27;s schedule&quot; on this.<p>4. The egos.  A large segment of the software world seems to be composed of people who keep trying to one-up each others in their knowledge of esoteric trivia, and then once they&#x27;ve found something they know that nobody else does, suddenly everyone else is an idiot.  This is exhausting and not all that pleasant.  It is much more prevalent in some communities than others - there are places you can go that are quite supportive, where <i>everybody</i> is interested in learning new things and new knowledge is gently pointed out and explained - but if you read many of the places where programmers gather, there are many a pissing contest that are just complete wastes of time.";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"gschiller";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"11";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"6170757";s:10:"story_text";s:138:"I&#x27;m a high school senior considering majoring in computer science.

But there are people who get PhD&#x27;s in music theory. What do you think they study for all those years? It&#x27;s not this.<p>Saying this is music theory is like saying arithmetic is math. It&#x27;s not wrong, exactly, but it&#x27;s leaving out a lot. People spend the first 12 years or more of their math education learning the notation, learning formulas, at least partly because you need to know that stuff in order to do any real math (we&#x27;ll leave the discussion of whether this is the optimal pedagogy for another day, shall we?). You could say, &quot;but people googling math want to understand <i>why</i> 2+2=4,&quot; but if you don&#x27;t know that 2+2=4, there&#x27;s not much point in trying to learn why. You could also say that what people learned in high school is what most people call math, but we all know that what people learn in high school math doesn&#x27;t have much to do with what real mathematicians do.<p>&quot;Real music theory&quot; uses the contents of these cheat sheets (and many, many other things) to describe pieces of music and to try to understand things like: why did this composer choose the notes and rhythms they did? What can we use to justify the subjective observation that a composer or time period had a unified music style? What are the assumptions of musical language that govern musical composition without necessarily being known to the composers? Why does this collection of notes have meaning? What is that meaning? What does the content of this music tell us about how it should be performed?<p>The best of my music theory classes tried to keep a clear line from what we were learning to the kinds of questions above. The worst classes we spent a lot of time doing worksheets with the musical equivalent of times tables and algebraic equations, ad nauseam.<p>---<p>I&#x27;d also like to note that the things that appear under the aegis of introductory music theory are a strange hybrid of techniques, reflecting the multiple purposes of music theory for theorists, musicologists, composers, and practitioners. So you get things that don&#x27;t help much with analysis, like species counterpoint (probably a useful exercise for composers, and maybe for musicologists since it is really a historical curiosity, but not really useful for anyone else) or realising figured bass (really only necessary if you&#x27;re going to be performing baroque music in period style on a keyboard instrument).<p>You could again say similar things about high school math of course.";s:12:"story_author";s:5:"Tomte";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"8472157";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}}s:8:"checksum";i:4251724643;s:10:"warmupTime";d:24195;}i:22;a:13:{s:10:"avgFastest";i:121785;s:2:"cv";d:17.08;s:3:"avg";d:125424;s:12:"cvAvgFastest";d:2.24;s:4:"cold";d:334816;s:7:"fastest";d:115186;s:7:"slowest";d:334816;s:5:"times";a:100:{i:0;d:334816;i:1;d:132402;i:2;d:127563;i:3;d:130058;i:4;d:132517;i:5;d:115186;i:6;d:130854;i:7;d:123194;i:8;d:124490;i:9;d:117157;i:10;d:122751;i:11;d:118363;i:12;d:125933;i:13;d:123986;i:14;d:122132;i:15;d:124322;i:16;d:123552;i:17;d:126110;i:18;d:125145;i:19;d:127083;i:20;d:118682;i:21;d:130248;i:22;d:128386;i:23;d:129389;i:24;d:129882;i:25;d:129570;i:26;d:128945;i:27;d:131019;i:28;d:130428;i:29;d:130536;i:30;d:129966;i:31;d:131444;i:32;d:127580;i:33;d:115567;i:34;d:120019;i:35;d:118696;i:36;d:118423;i:37;d:117667;i:38;d:119358;i:39;d:126922;i:40;d:125831;i:41;d:121414;i:42;d:120350;i:43;d:124522;i:44;d:123923;i:45;d:116897;i:46;d:126142;i:47;d:123791;i:48;d:125847;i:49;d:117782;i:50;d:121836;i:51;d:125388;i:52;d:125271;i:53;d:120174;i:54;d:119776;i:55;d:126450;i:56;d:120993;i:57;d:124756;i:58;d:121554;i:59;d:117108;i:60;d:117411;i:61;d:124728;i:62;d:124180;i:63;d:126292;i:64;d:124179;i:65;d:124835;i:66;d:119632;i:67;d:121148;i:68;d:120483;i:69;d:121227;i:70;d:125774;i:71;d:121797;i:72;d:121932;i:73;d:121201;i:74;d:121634;i:75;d:121976;i:76;d:122218;i:77;d:122787;i:78;d:122326;i:79;d:119871;i:80;d:120611;i:81;d:123932;i:82;d:121209;i:83;d:121044;i:84;d:121731;i:85;d:120137;i:86;d:122904;i:87;d:120339;i:88;d:120705;i:89;d:121751;i:90;d:119148;i:91;d:122740;i:92;d:123201;i:93;d:120512;i:94;d:121709;i:95;d:121154;i:96;d:120357;i:97;d:120816;i:98;d:117599;i:99;d:125066;}s:13:"originalQuery";s:61:"select * from hn_small order by comment_ranking desc limit 20";s:13:"modifiedQuery";s:73:"select * from hn_small order by comment_ranking desc limit 20 FORMAT JSON";s:6:"result";a:20:{i:0;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"64";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"sscheper";s:10:"comment_id";s:6:"844463";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:4:"1305";s:12:"comment_text";s:6:"search";s:12:"story_author";s:2:"pg";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:4:"1216";s:8:"story_id";s:3:"363";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:1;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"117";s:14:"comment_author";s:4:"xlnt";s:10:"comment_id";s:6:"222412";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:4:"1296";s:12:"comment_text";s:83:"make it so comments can't be modded below -5 (or -10). there's no value after that.";s:12:"story_author";s:2:"pg";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:4:"1216";s:8:"story_id";s:3:"363";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:2;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"40";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"321abc";s:10:"comment_id";s:6:"677658";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:4:"1289";s:12:"comment_text";s:32:"Please allow anonymous comments.";s:12:"story_author";s:2:"pg";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:4:"1216";s:8:"story_id";s:3:"363";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:3;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"87";s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"DabAsteroid";s:10:"comment_id";s:6:"297840";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:4:"1287";s:12:"comment_text";s:46:"Negative Karma-points for each duplicate post.";s:12:"story_author";s:2:"pg";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:4:"1216";s:8:"story_id";s:3:"363";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:4;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"87";s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"DabAsteroid";s:10:"comment_id";s:6:"298768";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:4:"1281";s:12:"comment_text";s:72:"Charge money for voting.

The Computer History Museum has a bunch of volunteer hardware/software hackers who restore vintage main-frames.

These are the kind of people that I want to spend time with.<p>My team and I just moved to Silicon Valley this past year, and we're setting up out entire lives around the idea of having a series of start-ups.  We've driven a combined total of 12 thousand miles to get here.  We're set up financially so we can afford to iterate through start-up ideas without breaking the bank.  We have a great space to work in, and we're meeting a lot of cool people.  I actually talked with a man a few weeks ago who knew William Shockley of Shockley Semiconductor fame.  <p>Yeah, It's been a hard road just to get to Silicon Valley.  I'm sad that I didn't get in to the startup school.  But, I'm sure that I'm going to get a lot more rejections throughout my career as an entrepreneur.  If I wanted something easy, I'd choose a different career.   I'm doing this because I enjoy the challenge.  I'm doing this because I love technology.  I'm doing this because I love the game, and I'm in it for the long haul.

In two days, you have managed to create a community more fucked up than YouTube.<p>2. I started watching <i>because</i> of the outrageous stuff other viewers were doing.  When you go to curb the abuse, be aware of this.  Many of your viewers may be watching only because folks are doing stupid stuff like ordering pizza and making yCombinator pay for it.  Lose the hassles and you may lose the audience.<p>3. Reality TV shows succeed because they're <i>unreal</i>.  TV execs hype up and dramatize all sorts of conflict, because that's what gets viewers to tune in.  Nobody wants to see an ordinary person's life, because it's <i>boring</i>.<p>4. Who do you want to be - Anna Nicole Smith or Paris Hilton.  Your success in attracting viewers is proportional to how trashy you are willing to become.  Anna Nicole Smith and Paris Hilton remain media darlings because we can look at them and think "Wow, look how pathetic they are."  It makes us feel good about ourselves.  Unless you are similarly pathetic, people will not want to look at you.  Respectable people like Tim Berners Lee or Steve Wozniak seldom end up on the news.<p>5. If you <i>are</i> respectable and still choose to go on reality TV, you're setting yourself up to be torn down.  The justin.tv tagline is accurate: "An exercise in narcissism".  Narcissism is going to prompt abuse.  People think that since you've set yourself up on a pedestal, you've given them an opening to tear you down.<p>6. I initially had logged in watch the yCombinator dinner.  That proved impractical because of the technology: the audio quality was shitty, the video would randomly drop out, and you couldn't really see anything anyway.  Part of the problem for attracting a decent community is there's nothing for <i>decent</i> people to do.  That leaves it as a festival for troublemakers.<p>7. Have you guys not read Shirky?

Plagiarism is a high form of flattery.

I see that additional structure as a good thing but I'm sure PG would argue that it's taking time away from hacking.<p>
The website of each company certainly shows a difference in mentality -- YC is stylized minimalism, TS is over the top web design you get when you pay someone too much to design you a site.<p><p>So what should you do?

Since Cobol and Fortran are useless, I had intensive courses to learn lisp, visual basic, php, .net and ruby. <p>There are still a few details left to smooth, but I think I am very close to be able to apply to YC.

There is only one thing that matters and PG was very clear on this. It is to come up with something that people will want and will be ready to pay for in some way (accept to view ads for instance). Wether you'r old, married & dad, have no technical skills in CS, etc. won't stop you from succeeding if you found a gold vein. It will just be a little bit more difficult to start, that's all... and maybe YC is not the VC to go for. ;-)
