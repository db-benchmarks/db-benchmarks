Spoiler alert: Dr. Gilbert was assigned this work by Kane's safety advocacy firm, with at least partial funding by trial lawyers.

  Here, too, is a problem: Dr. Gilbert said he relayed the results of that test and his concerns directly to Toyota. In short order Toyota looked into Dr. Gilbert's claims and found them not to be valid in terms of creating unintended acceleration. Then, to the company's surprise, it watched his appearance with Brian Ross on ABC News this past Monday night, Feb. 22.

  According to Toyota, it now appears that Dr. Gilbert had done something completely different in order to get a Toyota Avalon to accelerate under its own power. Toyota offered to evaluate Dr. Gilbert's Avalon, with ABC in attendance, and see what he did electronically to cause it to accelerate.

  Additionally, Toyota is fairly adamant that Gilbert's "test evaluation" on ABC News was not the original "discovery" he relayed to them on Feb. 16.</code></pre>";s:12:"story_author";s:4:"gyeh";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"23";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"1169830";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:7;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"194";s:14:"comment_author";s:4:"Dove";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"5539862";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"64";s:12:"comment_text";s:329:"I think the shapes would make more sense if they represented "do re me" instead of "ABC".

I apologize ahead of time for my brutal honesty.<p>You need to consider the possibility that you're not as competent as you believe yourself to be.  Dunning-Kruger[0] is real, and your post doesn't demonstrate the self-awareness the best developers seem to possess.<p>Your writing is sprinkled with emoticons and rife with reduplicated punctuation, both of which (especially the exclamation points) are common signs of immaturity.  Reading this diatribe--and assuming your 50 emails were written similarly--I am forced to accept one of two conclusions: either you're not aware that your writing is unprofessional, or you're aware that it's unprofessional and unconcerned.  Either option does not reflect well on you.  To put it bluntly, if I received an email from you in this style, I would archive it without response, assuming it was from someone who lacked the requisite introspective capability I expect from the people I want to work with.<p>I found it particularly telling that you claim that all five of your phone screens went "very well" but marveled that only three companies tried to set up an onsite interview with you.  Unless both the two companies that stopped at the phone screen simultaneously filled the position immediately after your phone screen, you really need to recognize that at least those two phone screens did not go well.  I do interviews at a large Internet company, and one of my goals--one of the goals that I've been trained to seek--is to ensure that the candidate, no matter how bad, walks away from the interview feeling good about himself/herself and the company.  If you're doing really poorly in an interview, I'll toss you some easier questions than I normally give, because I have all the information I need, and I don't want you to have a negative experience with my company.  You may have felt good about the phone screens, but the most likely explanation for the two companies that didn't bring you onsite is that you didn't actually do well enough to justify additional interviews.  These people <i>want</i> to hire someone, and if you were someone they wanted to hire, they certainly <i>would</i> have continued to interview you.<p>I think your experiment was less valid than you think it was because you're less competent than you think you are.<p>EDIT: I should add that whatever the case, whether I'm right or wrong about you, the best response to the situation you're in is to seek to improve yourself, not to embark on a quixotic venture to change others.  Read CS theory books, create and modify open source projects, solve fun programming puzzles: sharpen your skills and--no matter what your level of competency--your prospects will improve.<p>[0] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"up_and_up";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"61";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3351699";s:10:"story_text";s:4263:"TL;DR version: When developer talent sends you an email, you fail to reply!!!<p>==========<p>Full Version:<p>To all the startups and companies whining about lack of developer talent, I call your bluff.<p>I ran a little experiment over the last 60 days.

I sent emails to ~50 different companies (some well-known, others unknown) that were looking for "Sr. Developers", particularly Ruby devs, as found on the major developer job sites (stackoverflow, Dice, Indeed, 37signals etc). I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting. I also picked companies that most closely matched my skillset. In my email I introduced myself and included my resume. Here is how I am represented in the email (paraphrased from actual text, ):<p>Given: X &#62; 7 &#38; Y &#62; 4,<p>"Sr. Level Developer, with X years exp. Y years of prof exp with Ruby. Main expertise is in Ruby, API's, MySQL and a bunch of other stuff. Previously worked for 'ABC' startup ($X Millions angel backed) for two years and helped build out the entire app/platform etc. Later served as CTO for several side projects. I attended Top Tier University , ...  blah blah blah"<p>More stats:<p>Salary expectations: $115K<p>Areas of interest: API's, Analytics, SaaS, Telephony, Machine learning ....<p>Ability to relocate: Open to idea, can't right away<p>Telecommuter?: Pretty please<p>Snark level: Not nearly as high as this post ;)<p>Likeability: Very high<p>So out of ~50 companies that I tried contacting what was the result?<p>10/50 - sent me a reply email of some sort (confirmation, autoreply, whatever)<p>7/50 - tried to setup a phone screen<p>5/50 - actually completed the phone screen (with all phones screens going very well, I might add)<p>3/50 - tried to setup a technical interview<p>0/50 - actually completed a technical interview<p>0/50 - made offer!<p>From my 60 day simple experiment, I argue......<p>The top 5 reasons you are (probably) not hiring:<p>1. You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc". If you think of "Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting";}i:18;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:14:"comment_author";s:9:"JCordeiro";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3946441";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"26";s:12:"comment_text";s:20:"This is lame by ABC.";s:12:"story_author";s:10:"seanmccann";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"29";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3946008";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:19;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:14:"comment_author";s:9:"ReadyNSet";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1963094";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"33";s:12:"comment_text";s:236:"Launched an iPhone app for young ones to learn alphabet by popping balloons :)<p><a href="http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/popn-learn-abc/id400222528?mt=8" rel="nofollow">http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/popn-learn-abc/id400222528?mt...</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"commiebob";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"62";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"1962465";s:10:"story_text";s:179:"I know there were a lot of people working on launching an app by the end of November.<p>Well, it's December 2, so I figure it's time for some show and tell.<p>How did everyone do?";}}s:5:"stats";s:0:"";s:8:"checksum";i:2033323657;s:10:"warmupTime";d:12097;s:6:"retest";b:0;}i:14;a:15:{s:10:"avgFastest";i:41418;s:2:"cv";d:9.75;s:3:"avg";d:42782;s:12:"cvAvgFastest";d:3.51;s:4:"cold";d:74850;s:7:"fastest";d:38257;s:7:"slowest";d:74850;s:5:"times";a:100:{i:0;d:74850;i:1;d:47161;i:2;d:45062;i:3;d:48125;i:4;d:40430;i:5;d:42565;i:6;d:41026;i:7;d:40779;i:8;d:41658;i:9;d:43910;i:10;d:40581;i:11;d:40232;i:12;d:40591;i:13;d:41650;i:14;d:43379;i:15;d:41074;i:16;d:38257;i:17;d:41714;i:18;d:42264;i:19;d:44525;i:20;d:49289;i:21;d:41223;i:22;d:39980;i:23;d:39978;i:24;d:45811;i:25;d:42105;i:26;d:41053;i:27;d:44589;i:28;d:40487;i:29;d:44981;i:30;d:40591;i:31;d:43951;i:32;d:42416;i:33;d:41522;i:34;d:44160;i:35;d:43137;i:36;d:38532;i:37;d:41128;i:38;d:45472;i:39;d:40013;i:40;d:40019;i:41;d:45894;i:42;d:50206;i:43;d:39281;i:44;d:41638;i:45;d:41086;i:46;d:45300;i:47;d:42127;i:48;d:41597;i:49;d:40169;i:50;d:47539;i:51;d:44658;i:52;d:52031;i:53;d:42507;i:54;d:44206;i:55;d:45407;i:56;d:41030;i:57;d:40597;i:58;d:41225;i:59;d:40955;i:60;d:42733;i:61;d:38958;i:62;d:40671;i:63;d:42051;i:64;d:42283;i:65;d:41613;i:66;d:50083;i:67;d:41160;i:68;d:41830;i:69;d:41498;i:70;d:43830;i:71;d:40844;i:72;d:40289;i:73;d:39064;i:74;d:40575;i:75;d:39734;i:76;d:40209;i:77;d:45681;i:78;d:40303;i:79;d:40478;i:80;d:44859;i:81;d:46491;i:82;d:39605;i:83;d:40007;i:84;d:43959;i:85;d:42071;i:86;d:42579;i:87;d:41747;i:88;d:45705;i:89;d:41953;i:90;d:44857;i:91;d:41030;i:92;d:40525;i:93;d:44106;i:94;d:40545;i:95;d:42194;i:96;d:40200;i:97;d:43029;i:98;d:40939;i:99;d:40279;}s:13:"originalQuery";s:58:"select * from hn_small where match('abc -google') limit 20";s:13:"modifiedQuery";s:357:"select * from hn_small where (match(story_text, '(?i)\Wabc\W') or match(story_author,'(?i)\Wabc\W') or match(comment_text, '(?i)\Wabc\W') or match(comment_author, '(?i)\Wabc\W')) and not (match(story_text, '(?i)\Wgoogle\W') or match(story_author,'(?i)\Wgoogle\W') or match(comment_text, '(?i)\Wgoogle\W') or match(comment_author, '(?i)\Wgoogle\W')) limit 20";s:6:"result";a:20:{i:0;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"542";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"derefr";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"7794674";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:664:"I think everyone is misinterpreting the question.

There was no real focus on investigative journalism, or analysis of the actual statistics by news organizations. There was also the whole rigged ABC News broadcast, which they admitted later to faking. Toyota's Recall became the top most reported story in Jan-Feb 2010.  And IIRC, as the media hysteria was winding down, the NHTSA concluded the majority of unintended acceleration was driver error.<p>In Apple's case, they had made a weakspot into a visual accent. And Jobs mentioned their algorithms made things appear more dramatic than they were. Both of these things were probably dumb, but dumb-like-the-recessed-headphone-jack (gaffe), not dumb-like-the-Microsoft-Kin (flawed design). The software fix is already out and the hardware will probably get fixed next iteration (perhaps coated?) and isn't a big deal. Yet the media coverage greatly outpaced the issue, and again no mention of statistics or data.<p>There are a lot of parties interested in seeing these reputable companies take a dive. It's great for competitors; but more cynically - its great for hedge fund managers with certain short positions... Reporting misinformation and sensationalizing news for securities price manipulation isn't new, and it's been done to Apple before.<p>From 2006:<p><i>Aaron Task:  Okay.  Another stock that a lot of people are focused on right now seems to be Apple.</i><p><i>Jim Cramer: Yeah.  Apples very important to spread the rumor that both Verizon and ATT have decided they dont like the phone.

The way you would do that is you pick up the phone and you call six trading desks and say, Listen, I just got off the phone with my contact at Verizon and he has already said, Listen, were a Lucky G house.  Were a Samsung house.  Were a Motorola house.  Theres no room for Apple.  They want too much.  Were not gonna let them in.  Were not gonna let them do what they did to music.

At my workplace the surveillance room, as in most casinos, is segregated from the rest of the building by a separate entrance. Surveillance staff are not permitted to socialize with other staff and can't work in any job in the casino other than surveillance. The room has restricted swipe access via thick steel double-doors aka a "man trap" with poured concrete blocks and reinforced metal plates in the walls, of course Pelco PTZ cameras covering the outside of the doors.<p>The camera system isn't accessible anywhere other than possibly in the ceiling of the gaming floor which would be pretty obvious having someone trying to splice in to a cable. Everything else goes to the surveillance room not to the server room other than maybe the corporate LAN and intrusion detection server but still that's a restricted access locked room but to get to that door there are several other steel doors you need to swipe through, not even the big boss has access to some of them, but I do ;)<p>Our surveillance manager was telling me he trained in Las Vegas at some guy's house who teaches surveillance techniques to people in the industry. This guy has a multi camera setup in his home and tables too. He cheats at cards while on camera then shows it to the trainees but even he can't see himself cheating on camera even though he did it himself and knew he was on camera.<p>Although I should add most times cheating especially Blackjack is from collusion between player and dealer.

I apologize ahead of time for my brutal honesty.<p>You need to consider the possibility that you're not as competent as you believe yourself to be.  Dunning-Kruger[0] is real, and your post doesn't demonstrate the self-awareness the best developers seem to possess.<p>Your writing is sprinkled with emoticons and rife with reduplicated punctuation, both of which (especially the exclamation points) are common signs of immaturity.  Reading this diatribe--and assuming your 50 emails were written similarly--I am forced to accept one of two conclusions: either you're not aware that your writing is unprofessional, or you're aware that it's unprofessional and unconcerned.  Either option does not reflect well on you.  To put it bluntly, if I received an email from you in this style, I would archive it without response, assuming it was from someone who lacked the requisite introspective capability I expect from the people I want to work with.<p>I found it particularly telling that you claim that all five of your phone screens went "very well" but marveled that only three companies tried to set up an onsite interview with you.  Unless both the two companies that stopped at the phone screen simultaneously filled the position immediately after your phone screen, you really need to recognize that at least those two phone screens did not go well.  I do interviews at a large Internet company, and one of my goals--one of the goals that I've been trained to seek--is to ensure that the candidate, no matter how bad, walks away from the interview feeling good about himself/herself and the company.  If you're doing really poorly in an interview, I'll toss you some easier questions than I normally give, because I have all the information I need, and I don't want you to have a negative experience with my company.  You may have felt good about the phone screens, but the most likely explanation for the two companies that didn't bring you onsite is that you didn't actually do well enough to justify additional interviews.  These people <i>want</i> to hire someone, and if you were someone they wanted to hire, they certainly <i>would</i> have continued to interview you.<p>I think your experiment was less valid than you think it was because you're less competent than you think you are.<p>EDIT: I should add that whatever the case, whether I'm right or wrong about you, the best response to the situation you're in is to seek to improve yourself, not to embark on a quixotic venture to change others.  Read CS theory books, create and modify open source projects, solve fun programming puzzles: sharpen your skills and--no matter what your level of competency--your prospects will improve.<p>[0] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"up_and_up";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"61";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3351699";s:10:"story_text";s:4263:"TL;DR version: When developer talent sends you an email, you fail to reply!!!<p>==========<p>Full Version:<p>To all the startups and companies whining about lack of developer talent, I call your bluff.<p>I ran a little experiment over the last 60 days.

It has actually allowed rapid development of the start-up scene in my country who are in direct competition with the bay area. The best part is unlike the bay area most of the tech workers are able to save a majority of their money as the living cost is dirt cheap compared to the disgusting wealth extraction from the young and talented that happens in the bay area.<p>Now just for a second imagine if these tech hubs grow and take a large market share from the likes of google and facebook ?<p>As a student of Computer science who doesn&#x27;t happen to be the the united states all this is really good news and I wish the govt doesn&#x27;t listen to PG as it results in the 95% to  decentralize the wealth generated from technology from the hands of PG and silicon valley.

Technical people have such a deep love of science and tech that they sometimes forget about the economic and political realities of modern western societies: capital rules all.<p>Understanding and managing time and capital is the most important task any individual is faced with in the western world. As I&#x27;ve said many times, every single person reading HN most likely undervalues their time, and ends up severely miscalculating their opportunity costs as a result. The nature of capitalism is such that taking risk is the only path forward, regardless of how many failures it results in.<p>As the commenters above have noted, very few become billionaires by working 9 to 5 for someone else.

Take absolute control of your time. No overtime, no crunch time, no favors.<p>Understand the system we operate in, and optimize for it.

This is unquestionably a solid way to prove things about your program but it is too much of pain to expect this to have significant adoption in the &quot;real&quot; world.<p>In the hardware world, there&#x27;s been a lot of progress in automated verification thanks to modern model checkers [1,2] (which incidentally build on modern SAT, and in some cases SMT, solvers [3-6]). The nice thing about model checkers is that you just specify the property you want proven and let the verifier crunch away and it will (hopefully) come up with a proof or a counterexample.

With the JASPER tool, it was much less of a pain to configure the model checker, abstract away parts of the design, keep track of the properties specified and proven, examine counter example traces and so forth than I was expecting. A lot of this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t get done in academic tools like ABC because it doesn&#x27;t count as research. But such improvements are extremely important if you want to push adoption of formal tools in an industrial setting. And from what I can see the emphasis on usability seems to paying off for JASPER.<p>Model checking in software has been less successful because the state explosion problem is much more pronounced but there have been notable success stories like Microsoft Research&#x27;s SLAM project [7]. And I definitely think there is an opportunity here to build upon the algorithmic progress in automated verification in order to build tools that are much usable in a software setting.<p>[1] <a href="http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bradleya/ic3/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecee.colorado.edu&#x2F;~bradleya&#x2F;ic3&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/abc.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~alanmi&#x2F;abc&#x2F;abc.htm</a><p>[3] <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.princeton.edu&#x2F;~chaff&#x2F;zchaff.html</a><p>[4] <a href="http://minisat.se/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;minisat.se&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fmv.jku.at&#x2F;picosat&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href="http://z3.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;z3.codeplex.com&#x2F;</a><p>[7] <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;projects&#x2F;slam&#x2F;</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"dllthomas";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7618406";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:3;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"johnnygood";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1720899";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:4384:"Rails is based around the idea that the simple cases don't need a lot of explanation to the computer.  So, let's say that you have an Article model.<p><pre><code>  class Article &#60; ActiveRecord::Base
  end
</code></pre>
There's no need to do things like 1) tell it which database table to use; 2) tell it the setters and getters you want.  Those can be inferred.  Well, it's called Article so it'll use the articles table and we're going to want a setter and getter for each column.<p>Now, that can be overridden.  You can call set_table_name to explicitly tell it to use a table, you can add additional methods, you can override the default setters and getters, etc.  That's the idea behind Rails. You need a programming language to describe the decisions you're making that affect how your application works, but for a lot of things you're doing the same thing over and over and there's no reason to keep doing the same thing over and over.<p>Let's say that you wanted to (by default) order the articles by their creation date:<p><pre><code>  class Article &#60; ActiveRecord::Base
    default_scope :order =&#62; "created_at DESC"
  end
</code></pre>
You've now defined some business logic so that when you call Article.all, you get them in that order.  On the models, you can define any amount of logic you want by creating instance or class methods.  In fact, all of those fancy keywords are just mix-ins - method calls that add methods to your class.<p>This is why it looks like Rails is lacking a bit of business.  When you call belongs_to :apple, the belongs_to method gets executed as the class is interpreted and that belongs_to method is something like:<p><pre><code>  def belongs_to(associated)
    define_method associated do
      associated.to_s.camelize.constantize.find(send("#{associated}_id"))
    end

    define_method "#{associated}=" do |val|
      send("#{associated}_id=", val.id)
    end
  end
</code></pre>
Now, it's more complicated than that (since belongs_to adds some additional features), but that's the basic premise.  You have this foreign key association and, most often, it's a simple association where you want to define a setter and a getter for that association.  So, the belongs_to method takes the name and pops out two methods based on that name.  The first is the getter and it makes the name you input into a camel-case and gets the constant with that name.  It calls the find method on that constant and inputs the foreign key value to the find method.  Likewise, the setter (setters in Ruby are methods that end with the equals sign) and sets the "name underscore id" attribute on the model to the id of the associated object.<p>But you could just as easily define the methods yourself in the Article class rather than using the helper mix-in. Likewise, if you have business logic that doesn't fit in with what's already made, you can define any methods you want on your model classes.<p>The same goes for controllers.  Controllers can be pretty small.  If you're just trying to get the latest 10 articles, there isn't a lot you have to do - you need to fetch them from the database and store them in a variable.  This is another one of those areas where Rails doesn't ask you for things it can assume.  Instance variables (which start with the "@" symbol) get passed to the template, local variables (which have no prefix) don't go to the template.  The template that gets rendered is the one named "controller/action".  Of course, you can override that and call render :template =&#62; "xyz/abc" if you like.<p>I'm sorry if this seems a little all over the place, but I'm not sure what kind of business logic you're looking to implement.  If you give me an example, I can provide some insight.  However, from what you've said, it looks like you've just seen the basics of what models can do - and that's because a lot of the intro code is "let's build a blog" where there isn't a ton of business logic.  But you can make any methods (class or instance) you like to do things to your data.  Rails creates the basic cases for you - because the basic cases are well-understood.  However, you can make them more complex:<p><pre><code>  class Article &#60; ActiveRecord::Base
    def title
      if Time.now.day == 1 and Time.now.month == 4
        return title.reverse
      else
        return title
      end
    end

The TechCrunch article doesn't really provide enough detail, saying only that the staff was fired in order to "reduce the companys liability" which doesn't really make sense.<p>I am not a lawyer, but as an investor I have seen this happen before.  My guess (no connection to the company, wasn't aware of them prior to today) is that in lieu of filing for bankruptcy, they did an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors.<p>But what may have happened is:
1. OnLive recognizes that they're essentially bankrupt.  Directors and managers now have a fiduciary duty to maximize the recovery for creditors, not for shareholders.<p>2. Instead of going through a formal bankruptcy process, the company does an Assignment for the Benefit of Creditors (see a good explanation here [1]).  Any price paid for the assets by a buyer above what is owed to the creditors goes to satisfy the liquidation preferences, though it's unlikely there will be much if any recovery of value above the debts owed to the creditors.  The value of the common equity is totally wiped out (both common stock and employee options) as the total value of the assets is well below the amount due creditors + the liquidation preferences.<p>3. A buyer for the assets (the source of money with which to pay off the creditors who now own the assets of the defunct company) forms a new company, call it OnLive Asset Acquisition Corp.<p>4. OnLive Asset Acquisition Corp purchases the assets (not the stock) of the defunct corporation now owned by creditors.  The new acquirer buys the assets so as to avoid any existing/potential liabilities of the defunct corporation from whom it purchases the assets.  Imagine there's a company whose only asset is a rack of servers that you wish to purchase.  To gain ownership of the servers, you could buy all the shares of the company or you could just buy the servers as an asset with no encumbrances.  You would likely do the latter, as buying the stock comes with potential liabilities for past/future money owed or lawsuits.  That's likely what happened here, but for IP, etc.<p>5. The original employer OnLive is no longer operating.  The employees are all terminated, as their employer is gone and its operating assets are owned by a new company.  The new company may or may not seek to hire some or all of the employees of the defunct company.<p>6. Even if employees had been able to exercise their options, they were virtually certain to be worthless.  There is no way the price paid by the new owner for the assets of the dead company would exceed the debts + liquidation preferences (otherwise the directors wouldn't have liquidated it).  Had the employees exercised their options, any cash they paid to do so would have gone to the creditors to satisfy the company's debts and they would have received zero in proceeds.<p>It's a sad story for the employees, but there are rarely any happy outcomes for a company in bankruptcy.<p>Again, I'm purely speculating on what happened.  But based on the facts disclosed so far, it's not clear that one can conclude that the employees received a specific and unusual screwing by management vs. a typical screwing associated with the liquidation of a bankrupt employer.<p>[1] <a href="http://bankruptcy.cooley.com/2008/03/articles/the-financially-troubled-compa/assignments-for-the-benefit-of-creditors-simple-as-abc/" rel="nofollow">http://bankruptcy.cooley.com/2008/03/articles/the-financiall...</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:2:"il";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"13";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"4398979";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:5;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"101";s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"weavejester";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1342902";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:4328:"Mike, Git seems unintuitive because you don't have a good grasp of what it does behind the scenes. Imagine trying to get to grips with a Unix shell, if you had no concept of files or directories. In such a scenario, even a simple command like "cat" would seem incomprehensible.<p>If you'll indulge me, I'd like to propose a thought experiment.<p>* * Designing a patch database * *<p>Consider you're responsible for administering a busy open source project. You get dozens of patches a day from developers and you find it increasingly difficult to keep track of them. How might you go about managing this influx of patch files?<p>The first thing you might consider is how do you know what each patch is supposed to do? How do you know who to contact about the patch? Or when the patch was sent to you?<p>The solution to this is not too tricky; you just add some metadata to the patch detailing the author, the date, a description of the patch and so forth.<p>The next problem you face is that some patches rely on other patches. For instance, Bob might publicly post a patch for a great new scheduler, but then Carol might post a patch correcting some bugs in Bob's code. Carol's patch cannot be applied without first applying Bob's patch.<p>So you allow each patch to have parents. The parent of Carol's patch would be Bob's patch.<p>You've solved two major problems, but now you face one final one. If you want to talk to other people about these patches, you need a common naming scheme. It's going to be problematic if you label a patch as ABC on your system, but a colleague labels a patch as XYZ. So you either need a central naming database, or some algorithm that can guarantee everyone gives the same label to the same patch.<p>Fortunately, we have such algorithms; they're called one-way hashes. You take the contents of the patch, its metadata and parents, serialize all of that and SHA1 the result.<p>Three perfectly logical solutions, and ones you may even have come up with yourself under similar circumstances.<p>* * Merging patches * *<p>Under this system, how would a merge be performed? Let's say you have two patches, A and B, and you want to combine them somehow. One way is to just apply each in turn to your source, fix any differences that can't be automatically resolved (conflicts), and then produce a new patch C from the combined diff.<p>That works, but now you have to store A, B and C in your patch database, and you don't retain any history. But wait! Your patches can have parents, so what if you created a 'merge' patch, M, with parents A and B?<p><pre><code>   A   B
    \ /
     M
</code></pre>
This is externally equivalent to what you did to produce C: patches A and B are applied to the source code, and then you apply M to resolve the differences. M will contain both the differences that can be resolved automatically, and any conflicts we have to resolve manually.<p>Having solved your problem, you write the code to your patch database and present the resulting program to your colleague.<p>* * A user tries to merge * *<p>"How do I merge?" he asks.<p>"I've written a tool to help you do that," you say, "Just specify the two patches you want to combine, and the tool will merge them together."<p>"Um, it says I have a merge conflict."<p>"Well, fix the problem, then tell the system to add your file to the 'merge patch' it's making."<p>Your colleague dutifully hacks away, and solves the conflict. "So I've fixed the file," he says, "But when I tell it to 'commit file' it fails."<p>"Remember, this is a patch database," you reply, "We're not dealing with files, we're dealing with patches. You have to add your file changes to your patch, and then commit the patch. You can't commit an individual file."<p>"What? That's not very intuitive," he grumbles, "Hey! I've added the file to the patch, but it tells me the merge isn't complete!"<p>"You need to add all of the files that have differences that were automatically resolved as well."<p>"Why?!"<p>"Because," you explain patiently, "You might not like the way those files have been changed. It needs your approval that the way it's resolved the differences is correct."<p>"Why to I have to re-commit everything my buddy has made?" he complains, "Seriously, I want to just commit <i>one</i> file.

I think I went to Walmart, Best Buy, Target, ABC Warehouse, and finally Circuit City. At almost every store the "salespeople" knew almost nothing about what they were selling and there products were way too expensive for what they were. The only store that stood out to me was Circuit City. Not only did they have a good selection of quality TVs but the salesman I spoke with impressed the hell out me as he was the first that knew more about the TVs than I did.

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5834687";s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

There was no real focus on investigative journalism, or analysis of the actual statistics by news organizations. There was also the whole rigged ABC News broadcast, which they admitted later to faking. Toyota's Recall became the top most reported story in Jan-Feb 2010.  And IIRC, as the media hysteria was winding down, the NHTSA concluded the majority of unintended acceleration was driver error.<p>In Apple's case, they had made a weakspot into a visual accent.

Some people think that the US have no intention of wanting to extradite and charge Assange, but Assange and his counsel have repeatedly (in the last month) requested that the US make a statement confirming this. The matter of the fact is, many high profile American's have said that he should be killed, and put to death.<p>Onto the other topic of the rape charges, I think some people don't fully understand the facts surrounding the charge. I didn't either until I spent thirty minutes and read this article: <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2012/07/19/3549280.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/stories/2012/07/19/3549280.ht...</a><p>But from this transcript... these are the key points:<p>-------------<p>The "sexual assault/rape/molestation" charges were filed after two women Anna Ardin and Sofia Wilen went to the police to seek advice if they could compel Assange to take a STD test since they did not use a condom during sex.<p>Both of the women went to the Klara police station in central Stockholm, however, it is mentioned that Ardin had gone along primarily to support Wilen.<p>Ardin had been frequently in the company of Assange. She had previously described him as such a "cool man" (Twitter). They also arrived and left together at a Crayfish party (equivalent of a cocktail party). Ardin was sharing accomodation with Assange and had refused an offer from someone else for temporary accomodation.<p>The day after the accusation of rape and molesation Ardin sent a SMS saying : "I've just spent some time with the coolest people in the world".<p>SMS text messages were also exchanged between Sofia and Ardin, which showed that the two of them knew of the relationship between each other and Assange.<p>Ardin responded to a friend who was looking for Assange : "He's not here. He's planned to have sex with the cashmere girl every evening, but not made it. Maybe he finally found time yesterday?"<p>The Swedish police, totally railroaded the investigation. Interviews have been leaked with Assange, and Wilen commented initially "that she became so distraught she refused to give any more testimony and refused to sign what had been taken down.".
Assange went freely for interview to the police station and was released without immediate charge, and was free to travel. Almost immediately there after, another warrant was issued for his arrest.<p>Eventually, it was also upgraded to an Interpol "Red Notice".<p>It's alleged (from the transcripts), that Sweden has frankly always been the United States' lap dog and it's not a matter we are particularly proud of. The Swedish Government has... essentially, whenever a US official says, "Jump", the Sweden Government asks, "How high?"<p>Assange's legal team are clearly trying to point out that US is coercing all of this behind the scenes so that he can then be extradited from Sweden and face trial for conspiracy to commit espionage.<p>&#62; The burden should be on the United States Government to say, "We are not planning to prosecute Julian Assange". If they just gave that assurance, I can guarantee you that Julian Assange would go to Sweden tomorrow.<p>----------------<p>This is hugely and unequivocally politically motivated.

If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment. Some of that equipment is located onboard a fire truck or an ambulance. Most of that equipment is usually found inside the operating room of your local hospital.

Like the certainty that big oil has had the knowledge of clean, cheap energy and that they keep it secret to make money on oil... or that they&#x27;ll pump up oil prices to lure the alternative energy people to make business risks, and then purposely flood the market in order to put them out of business, etc.";s:12:"story_author";s:10:"tokenadult";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"8386268";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:10;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:4:"3504";s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"tokenadult";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"7820120";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:6442:"Volokh here is decrying the same kinds of policies that I decry, for many of the same reasons. Forcing people into Procrustean categories more narrow than &quot;citizen&quot; for the people of one country builds division in the country and keeps people from treating their neighbors humanely as their fellow human beings. That kind of categorization was wrong and a moral outrage in the days of Jim Crow legally enforced segregation and it is still a bad idea today, even to correct the previous wrong.<p>I care about this issue deeply. I&#x27;m a baby boomer, which is another way of saying that I&#x27;m a good bit older than most people who post on Hacker News. I distinctly remember the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated--the most memorable day of early childhood for many people in my generation--and I remember the &quot;long hot summer&quot; and other events of the 1960s civil rights movement.<p>One early memory I have is of a second grade classmate (I still remember his name, which alas is just common enough that it is hard to Google him up) who moved back to Minnesota with his northern &quot;white&quot; parents after spending his early years in Alabama. He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was &quot;Negroes&quot;), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. He made me aware of a society in which people didn&#x27;t all treat one another with decency and human compassion, unlike the only kind of society I was initially aware of from growing up where I did. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn&#x27;t shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC) affirmative action program. (To me, the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don&#x27;t.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;Afro-American&quot; or &quot;black&quot; was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, &quot;What do you want to be called, &#x27;black&#x27; or &#x27;Afro-American&#x27;?&quot; His answer was, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be called Henry.&quot; Henry&#x27;s answer to my classmate&#x27;s innocent question really got me thinking. Why not treat all of my neighbors as individuals, one at a time?<p>And anyway I&#x27;ve seen this issue go wrong for people in other countries. Also in my childhood, in the other state I lived in growing up, I had a classmate in the early 1970s who would get on the school bus each day wearing a button that said &quot;Serb Power.&quot; I thought that was very strange, because I knew my history well enough to know that Serbia hadn&#x27;t been an independent country since Yugoslavia was formed after World War I. And, anyway, he was living in the United States and had been born here, so why was he so concerned about Serb power? We all found out during the early 1990s how crazy many people in Yugoslavia were about former historical grievances, which made that country disintegrate and killed many innocent people born long after the grievances should have been forgotten.<p>Most reporting to the federal government about &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; is based on the U.S. Census bureau definitions for ethnicity and race categories, which in turn are based on regulations from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which were announced on 30 October 1997<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitehouse.gov&#x2F;omb&#x2F;fedreg_1997standards</a><p>to take effect no later than 1 January 2003 for data collection by all federal agencies.

As the Census Bureau itself notes,<p>&quot;U.S. federal government agencies must adhere to standards issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in October 1997, which specify that  race  and Hispanic origin (also known as ethnicity) are two separate and distinct concepts.  These standards generally reflect a social definition of race and ethnicity recognized in this country and they do not conform to any biological, anthropological, or genetic criteria.  The standards include five minimum categories for data on race:  &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native,&quot; &quot;Asian,&quot; &quot;Black or African American,&quot; &quot;Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,&quot; and &quot;White.&quot;  There are two minimum categories for data on ethnicity:  &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; and &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino.&quot;  The concept of race reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify.  Persons who report themselves as Hispanic can be of any race and are identified as such in our data tables.&quot;<p><a href="https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.census.gov&#x2F;faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191</a><p>It&#x27;s politics all the way down.

You prove your theorems more or less by typing out the proofs and the system mechanically verifies that each step in your proof is sound. I&#x27;ve used Coq and I&#x27;ll be honest. This is unquestionably a solid way to prove things about your program but it is too much of pain to expect this to have significant adoption in the &quot;real&quot; world.<p>In the hardware world, there&#x27;s been a lot of progress in automated verification thanks to modern model checkers [1,2] (which incidentally build on modern SAT, and in some cases SMT, solvers [3-6]). The nice thing about model checkers is that you just specify the property you want proven and let the verifier crunch away and it will (hopefully) come up with a proof or a counterexample. This has been successful enough that there are companies like JASPER and OneSpin which make money by selling hardware companies formal verification tools.<p>I worked with JASPER&#x27;s tools in the recent-ish past and one of the big things they seem to have done is make the tool much more usable. With the JASPER tool, it was much less of a pain to configure the model checker, abstract away parts of the design, keep track of the properties specified and proven, examine counter example traces and so forth than I was expecting. A lot of this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t get done in academic tools like ABC because it doesn&#x27;t count as research. But such improvements are extremely important if you want to push adoption of formal tools in an industrial setting. And from what I can see the emphasis on usability seems to paying off for JASPER.<p>Model checking in software has been less successful because the state explosion problem is much more pronounced but there have been notable success stories like Microsoft Research&#x27;s SLAM project [7]. And I definitely think there is an opportunity here to build upon the algorithmic progress in automated verification in order to build tools that are much usable in a software setting.<p>[1] <a href="http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bradleya/ic3/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecee.colorado.edu&#x2F;~bradleya&#x2F;ic3&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/abc.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~alanmi&#x2F;abc&#x2F;abc.htm</a><p>[3] <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.princeton.edu&#x2F;~chaff&#x2F;zchaff.html</a><p>[4] <a href="http://minisat.se/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;minisat.se&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fmv.jku.at&#x2F;picosat&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href="http://z3.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;z3.codeplex.com&#x2F;</a><p>[7] <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;projects&#x2F;slam&#x2F;</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"dllthomas";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7618406";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:13;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"356";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"suprgeek";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"7485127";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:684:"This is tyranny sneaking up on us one &quot;No-XYZ list&quot; at a time.<p>They can put you on it for any reason (lets say you oppose one of the Govt. policies - Drone Bombings for example), you will be unable to find out why you are on said list or even if you are.<p>Since you cannot confirm that you are on said list you will not be able to get off it.

Really. I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on.

The majority of my students are experienced programmers, but no small number are new to programming beyond very simple stuff.   I&#x27;ve found that Python has a number of aspects that are ideal for first-time programmers:<p>- It&#x27;s dynamically typed.  Say what you want about static vs. dynamic typing, but this is one less thing that newbie programmers have to get right.  There&#x27;s no chance of an error when they say &quot;i = &#x27;abc&#x27;&quot;, if you&#x27;ve defined i to be an int.<p>- It&#x27;s interactive.  The fact that you can &quot;play&quot; with the language within the interactive shell is a huge selling point.  IPython and the IPython Notebook are easy to get working, and for people to work with.<p>- Python&#x27;s restricted command set and simple, regular syntax let you concentrate on ideas: Yes, many newbies to Python (and to programming in general) get confused by indentation, blocks, colons, and the like.  But they&#x27;re going to get confused by the syntax of nearly any language.  Python has a simpler syntax than most other languages, meaning that there&#x27;s less to learn, and less to remember.  This lets the new programmer concentrate on the ideas that they&#x27;re learning, or the implementation of what they&#x27;re doing.<p>- It&#x27;s cross platform.  The fact that people can use Python on any computer they like is a big selling point.<p>- You can easily teach object-oriented and functional-style programming.  Python is obviously object-oriented, but can also be used to introduce functional programming.  In this way, you can expose programmers not only to multiple paradigms in Python, but also in other languages.<p>- You can use it for real applications.  People are often surprised to discover that real-life applications are being written and used in this language that they&#x27;re learning, which seems so simple.<p>I&#x27;m sure that there are more reasons than these.  But let&#x27;s consider the alternatives that the article suggested:<p>- I would be hard-pressed to think of a <i>worse</i> first language than C.  You want to introduce people to the concepts of programming, which means abstractions and high-level thinking.  C forces you to think in terms of the computer and its memory, which is just the opposite.  The fact that it&#x27;s compiled to binary form, that you don&#x27;t have an interactive C shell, and pointers are just three reasons why I think that C would be a very bad choice.  Sure, everyone should learn C at some point -- although I often point out that I&#x27;m a much happier person since I moved to dynamic, high-level languages many years ago -- but if you want to teach the concepts of programming, C is going to require too much learning just to get simple things done.<p>- JavaScript has many good points for beginning programmers -- but the chief problem, in my mind, is the language&#x27;s syntax, which is far too inconsistent and forgiving&#x2F;flexible for newbies.  I think that someone coming to JavaScript from Python will have a very easy time; the mapping of data types is fairly straightforward, and even the notion of passing functions is pretty easy to get.  But the learning curve in JavaScript seems steeper to me than in Python, despite the obvious advantages of being able to work within a browser.";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"btimil";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7122163";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:17;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"70";s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"robbiet480";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"5999686";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:3795:"(latest info at bottom of comment)<p>ABC reports it was coming from Taipei, linked forum says Taipei.

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5834687";s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

My last job was as a full stack developer working on the following stack: Rails, RSpec, Backbone.js, CoffeeScript, Heroku, Postgres, Redis, Sidekiq, Pusher.<p>I'm applying to software engineering jobs right now and I have the following questions for the HN community:<p>1) How can I do better in technical interviews where they ask me CS questions? What have other people done in this situation?<p>2) Are CS fundamentals really important in the real world? Does it depend on the position? What if you're a JavaScript engineer working with Backbone, browser performance, etc.<p>3) Recommended courses (online or offline) to learn CS?<p>Right now I'm reading Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al.<p>Example interview questions:<p>* Given an array of negative and positive numbers (eg -100..100), find groups of two that sum to zero. Now find groups of three. Now find all groups.<p>* Implement a function that takes an integer n, and returns the number of 1's in the binary representation of n.<p>* Implement a function that takes takes 3 (x,y) coordinates which define the vertices of a triangle, and a 4th (x,y) coordinate, as inputs. Return true if the 4th point falls inside the triangle defined by the first 3 points; false otherwise.<p>* Write an extract_word_series() function that takes a string and returns a 2d nested array where the inner arrays are a group of contiguous words.

Bravo. Unfortunately, the permalinking fails with this particular regex, or I'd include it here. The visualization is so large, it more than fills my large screen. Still, pretty cool to see it render instantaneously and to watch it match example text. The regex is described here: <a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~cameron/REX.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~cameron/REX.html</a>
It will match either text or XML markup (it's used to tokenize XML), so try example text like '&#60;div id="123"&#62;abc' or 'abc&#60;?xml target?&#62;'.<p>The JavaScript form of the regex follows:

A lot of people who talk about Go use some variation on the phrase "small sets of orthogonal features"a phrase I feel applies to Go only by comparison with, say, C++and D doesn't succeed in that regard, but I feel like D really fits a lot of the points on the wish-list much more closely (e.g. template metaprogramming, data structures, objects, &#38;c. D's compile-time constructs are incredibly useful without the nastiness of the C preprocessor or C++'s templates.) One thing which draws me to D is the "you can, but you don't have to" attitude it takes towards certain featuresfor example, there is GC by default, but you can stop using it and do manual memory management if you feel like it's important.<p>The problem here, and the massive, massive thing keeping me from throwing my full recommendation behind it, is that D fails entirely on #7, because the community is small and so even installing libraries by hand can be tedious. I keep wanting to pull out D for personal projects, but then I come across some obscure, poorly-documented library with few/no alternatives, and after trying to build it for three hours, I give up and switch to something else. Recently, 'something else' has in fact been Go. I still feel like, in an ideal universe, I'd rather program in D than Go, but we do not live in an ideal universe, and of those two, Go is the practical choice. (And, despite my frustrations with Go, it is still better by leaps and bounds than Java and C++.)<p>Also, quick correction: any dynamic language worth its salt does the same short-circut evaluation with <i>and</i> and <i>or</i>, including Python, Ruby, Scheme, and Common Lisp, so they all have the property ascribed in this writeup to only JS and Perl. In Python, you can change whether instances of a class are 'true' or 'false' values by overloading the __nonzero__ method, which means e.g. empty user-defined data structures could be considered 'false' while non-empty ones could be 'true.' On the other hand, Ruby considers only false and nil to be false values, Scheme considers only #f to be a false value, and Common Lisp considers only nil to be a false value. Aside from individual quibbles about which values are true and false, all of these languages implement an <i>or</i> that returns the first true value it finds, and all of them implement an <i>and</i> that returns the first false value it finds.<p>EDIT: Lua also allows the short-circuit boolean operators to return values. The only widely-known dynamic language off the top of my head that doesn't do this is Smalltalk. This would be complicated to add to a type system, for relatively little gain, so as far as I know, no typed language allows it.";s:12:"story_author";s:8:"jemeshsu";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"23";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"2631964";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:13;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"921";s:14:"comment_author";s:13:"run4yourlives";s:10:"comment_id";s:6:"730340";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1733:"Hopefully helpful critique regarding the business itself:<p>1.

I can stay at a hostel or hotel chain and have a reasonable expectation of what to expect. I can't do that at a B&#38;B, but I can compare prices to get an idea of what would be up scale and what would be bargain basement. This site disables that, and brags about it. I really don't need to save $5 that badly.<p>About the process:<p>I think - humbly - that sometimes us geeks can get so caught up in the process of how we're building something that we lose sight of what it is we're actually building. This doesn't matter when you're making lego structures as a hobby, but it's completely relevant when you're trying to design a business.<p>How you do it is - in the end - largely irrelevant.

There, the culture is to live by the day, because winter never comes and they don't need to prepare for hard seasons. If they are hungry, fruits are always available, food is always provided by nature.<p>For this reason they don't plan ahead at work, they don't save money and they waste a lot of resources thinking that there will always be something provided to them.

This means a lot of things, for instance I don't care about what people do with my code, nor if they'll release back their modifications. I simply want people to use my code in one way or the other.<p>As other people (buster) have mentioned, they feel that releasing GPL code is contributing to humanity too.  Here's the difference as I see it:<p>You want to maximize the number of people who use your code, because that makes you feel good about yourself and your contribution.<p>Someone who releases GPL wants to try to maximize the good outcomes that result from their releasing that piece of code.<p>For example: the FreeBSD hackers get to know that their code was incorporated into OS X and used by many millions of people.  That's pretty cool for them.  But the contribution to humanity of their code is limited by that -- the OS X kernel's closed source, so no-one can benefit from learning how that works, and in the meantime the FreeBSD project itself is dwindling.  Meanwhile, e.g. Android is based on Linux, and is available to everyone to study.  Linux is growing hugely, and is an amazing example of humanity working together to achieve a public good.  I can't really say the same about FreeBSD.<p>So, I think the question is -- is your aim somewhat selfish, in wanting to maximize the consequences that can be directly traced to you, or is it driven by wanting to maximize the consequences to the rest of your society of your actions?<p>If the latter, I think there's an entirely reasonable argument that says that the GPL is a better way to do it.  There's no question that, as you argue, the GPL has less immediate freedom for each individual user than the BSD licenses.  But why should we measure freedom for each individual, if what we care about is the final level of freedom for everyone in society?<p>To put it another way, I think the BSD license can result in "tragedy of the commons" scenarios where maximizing <i>individual</i> freedom has worse total consequences than would have resulted by applying regulation to maximize <i>societal</i> freedom instead.";s:12:"story_author";s:13:"justincormack";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"23";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5124060";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:17;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"31";s:14:"comment_author";s:13:"alphaoverlord";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"7936143";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1765:"This blog post seems like a jumble of ideas that are neither consistent or connected.<p>It starts with colleges should be more than job training centers, then ends with trying to create an accreditation process to prove value to external entities (of which I assume employers are a big part?).<p>It mentions the high cost of education, then describes how his current options are lacking because the number of classes in each major is limited.<p>He talks about how administrators are unnecessary, then suggests a similarly labor intensive accreditation system that requires experts, committees and other logistics that requires significant manpower and time&#x2F;energy.<p>There are many flaws with the educational system, of which convenience, rigor, equality, and cost are a few the OP mentions, however his solution doesn&#x27;t seem to solve many of the challenges he mentions.

No matter how brilliant you think your idea is, I guarantee that if you spend a few days hashing it out with someone you consider your peer, it will end up being 10 times the product.

I got my rejection email yesterday.  I thought I'd be more disappointed at getting turned down, but I'm not.  It's actually motivated me to step out on my own.  <p>One of the big reasons that YC exists is to mentor young entrepreneurs.  I would love to have a mentor, but I think that I"m going to branch out on my own to find them, instead of drowning in the crowd at Start-up school to exchange three words with  Jessica or Paul.  Instead, I've been considering volunteering at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View to hang out with some elder geeks.  The Computer History Museum has a bunch of volunteer hardware/software hackers who restore vintage main-frames.  These are all really smart hackers who have spent decades in the tech business, and they are spending time in retirement doing geek stuff, because they love it.  These are the kind of people that I want to spend time with.<p>My team and I just moved to Silicon Valley this past year, and we're setting up out entire lives around the idea of having a series of start-ups.  We've driven a combined total of 12 thousand miles to get here.  We're set up financially so we can afford to iterate through start-up ideas without breaking the bank.  We have a great space to work in, and we're meeting a lot of cool people.  I actually talked with a man a few weeks ago who knew William Shockley of Shockley Semiconductor fame.  <p>Yeah, It's been a hard road just to get to Silicon Valley.  I'm sad that I didn't get in to the startup school.  But, I'm sure that I'm going to get a lot more rejections throughout my career as an entrepreneur.  If I wanted something easy, I'd choose a different career.   I'm doing this because I enjoy the challenge.  I'm doing this because I love technology.  I'm doing this because I love the game, and I'm in it for the long haul.

I didn't see an easily-accessible feedback link (note to other startup founders: include this), so I'll post my feedback here:<p>1. Congratulations.  In two days, you have managed to create a community more fucked up than YouTube.<p>2. I started watching <i>because</i> of the outrageous stuff other viewers were doing.  When you go to curb the abuse, be aware of this.  Many of your viewers may be watching only because folks are doing stupid stuff like ordering pizza and making yCombinator pay for it.  Lose the hassles and you may lose the audience.<p>3. Reality TV shows succeed because they're <i>unreal</i>.  TV execs hype up and dramatize all sorts of conflict, because that's what gets viewers to tune in.  Nobody wants to see an ordinary person's life, because it's <i>boring</i>.<p>4. Who do you want to be - Anna Nicole Smith or Paris Hilton.  Your success in attracting viewers is proportional to how trashy you are willing to become.  Anna Nicole Smith and Paris Hilton remain media darlings because we can look at them and think "Wow, look how pathetic they are."  It makes us feel good about ourselves.  Unless you are similarly pathetic, people will not want to look at you.  Respectable people like Tim Berners Lee or Steve Wozniak seldom end up on the news.<p>5. If you <i>are</i> respectable and still choose to go on reality TV, you're setting yourself up to be torn down.  The justin.tv tagline is accurate: "An exercise in narcissism".  Narcissism is going to prompt abuse.  People think that since you've set yourself up on a pedestal, you've given them an opening to tear you down.<p>6. I initially had logged in watch the yCombinator dinner.  That proved impractical because of the technology: the audio quality was shitty, the video would randomly drop out, and you couldn't really see anything anyway.  Part of the problem for attracting a decent community is there's nothing for <i>decent</i> people to do.  That leaves it as a festival for troublemakers.<p>7. Have you guys not read Shirky?

They even got the nerve to submit an app named "FaceBook for iPad". I think this proves that this is not just an unfortunate coincidence and they won't be willing to remove the app if I ask them directly.<p>Has any of you dealt with this situation before?
