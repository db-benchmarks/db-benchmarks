The original plan was to learn web programming since I imagined web applications were both fun to develop and the best shot at a start-up. I took up Python and developed a simple file sharing application on Google App Engine (you can see it at myfilesinthesky.com but you don't lose anything if you don't).<p>Well, thinking about the interface and implementing the programming logic was actually fun. And it took 10% of the time. The other 90% was spent fighting with browsers' quirkiness and with Google App Engine (if I skipped GAE I would have fought with sys admin so not better I suppose). And that was teeth-cringing.<p>So I am not really sure web programming is that fun after all and the next step would be now to learn javascript to start doing browser-side wizardry which from what I'm reading around looks like as teeth cringing as it gets (ok, cobol programming is worse, I am sure).<p>And then I read Paul Graham's essays on tablets - paulgraham.com/tablets.html - and I am thinking now that ipad programming can be still promising business wise but much more fun since you have full control of the device and building native apps. No more need to get crazy with browser UI and sys admin stuff!<p>Before I spend the w.e. of the next six months learning C, obj-C and Cocoa, let me ask you, what would you advise to an aspiring programmer, learn web programming or dive into tablet programming?";}i:3;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"740";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"uptown";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"2937159";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"8";s:12:"comment_text";s:630:"I'd use Google+ more if the default view didn't show everybody's posts.

Here are some of the things I do<p>- Establish conventions early; Conventions in managing projects, conventions in code. And stick to those conventions. Be predictable,
in the code. Use simple names.<p>- Protect your interfaces. By this I mean, use a central place like a wiki to document your interfaces, so all involved parties may agree upon. Write unit-tests for interfaces. Use libraries like mockito and hamcrest that make it a breeze.(You would lock your home every time you go out, don&#x27;t you?)<p>- I mentioned this in the previous bullet, but write tests. Write lots of them, write tests that document any tricky, magical behavior.
Cover all the cases(A boat with one hole is bad as one with two holes). Cover all the invariants, any thing that you notice but didn&#x27;t mention in the source code. Write tests for the bugs you just fixed.<p>- If you are developing in Java, please use an IDE. I use Intellij, but Eclipse is good too. It makes refactoring code much easier.
Rename fields, pull classes up the hierarchy, create abstract classes, create getters and setters automatically with refactoring tools. I am not against emacs or vi, but it is hard to manage Java&#x27;s sprawl with them.<p>One of the best programmers I know writes code like it has been generated with a program.

And the brake pedal would stop activating the brake system every 6 hours unless I turned the car off and restarted the engine.

Yes, usually complete rewrites are a Bad Idea, but in this case product and business decided it was the only way to move forward because the system was in maintenance hell and it was way too difficult and risky to add new features. I discovered why as I learned the architecture, business logic and features of this behemoth pile of spaghetti. Here&#x27;s what I recommend to do if you&#x27;re in a similar situation, whether it be a large and great project or a large and horrible project...<p>- Get a functional dev environment set up where you can mess around with things in a risk-free manner. This includes setting up any dev databases and other external dependencies so that you can add, update and delete data at will. There&#x27;s nothing that gives more insight than changing a piece of code and seeing what it breaks or alters. Change a lot of things, one at a time.<p>- Dive deep. This is time consuming, but don&#x27;t be satisfied with understanding a surface feature only. You must recursively learn the functions, modules and architecture those surface features are using as well until you get to the bottom of the stack. Once you know where the bottom is you know what everything else is based on. This knowledge will help you uncover tricky bugs later if you truly grok what&#x27;s going on. It will also give you insight as to the complexity of the project (and whether it&#x27;s inherent to the problem or unnecessary). This can take a lot of time, but it pays off the most.<p>- Read and run the tests (if any). The tests are (usually) a very clear and simple insight into otherwise complex functionality. This method should do this, this class should do that, we need to mock this other external dependency, etc.<p>- Read the documentation and comments (if any). This can really help you understand the how&#x27;s and why&#x27;s depending on the conscientiousness of the prior engineers.<p>- If there&#x27;s something that you really can&#x27;t untangle, contact the source. Tell him what you&#x27;re attempting, what you tried, exactly why and how it&#x27;s not working as you expect, and ask if there&#x27;s a simple resolution (I don&#x27;t want to waste your time if there&#x27;s not). You may not get an answer, but if you&#x27;ve done a lot of digging already and communicate the issue clearly you might get a &quot;Oh yeah, there&#x27;s a bug with XYZ due to the interaction with the ABC library. I haven&#x27;t had time to fix it but the problem is in the foo&#x2F;bar file.&quot; You may be able to find a workaround or fix the bug yourself.<p>- When you do become comfortable enough to add features or fix issues, put forward the effort to find the right place in the code to do this. If you think it requires refactoring other things first, do this in as atomic a manner as possible and consult first with other contributors.<p>- Pick a simple task to attack first, even if it&#x27;s imaginary. Get to more complicated stuff after you&#x27;ve done some legwork already.<p>There are other minor things but this is generally my approach.";s:12:"story_author";s:10:"roflc0ptic";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:3:"117";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"9784008";s:10:"story_text";s:1759:"My question is pretty straightforward: how do you, hacker news enthusiast, familiarize yourself with a new codebase? Obviously your answer is going to be contingent on the kind of work that you do.<p>Some background: What&#x27;s motivating me to ask is that I am flirting with the idea of trying to add a couple of features to SlickGrid (https:&#x2F;&#x2F;github.com&#x2F;mleibman&#x2F;SlickGrid), Michael Leibman&#x27;s phenomenal javascript grid widget. Unfortunately Leibman got busy and isn&#x27;t actively supporting it anymore.<p>The codebase is something like 8k lines of javascript, so it&#x27;s not ludicrously big, but I&#x27;m kind of intimidated thinking about trying to make sense of it. My first strategy is just to open up important-looking javascript files (slick.core.js, slick.grid.js) and read through for comprehension. This seems like a pretty slow way to build a mental model of the code, though. Some features I want to implement are 1. an ajax data source that doesn&#x27;t require paging, and 2. frozen columns. Someone else has implemented a buggy version of frozen columns (and since abandoned the project), and I might like to use it, but I can&#x27;t tell if it&#x27;s buggy because it&#x27;s a hard problem, or because their implementation strategy was poor (or both!). So at the moment I can&#x27;t evaluate if I should implement my own, or try to fix the issues with theirs.<p>Picking up other people&#x27;s code seems to be one of the harder tasks developers face, as evidenced by how much code gets abandoned, so I wondered if the voices of experience on here could point me in the right direction, either by talking about this problem in particular, or more generally, how you build knowledge about a new codebase.<p>Thanks!";}i:15;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"836";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"mgkimsal";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"3810660";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"3";s:12:"comment_text";s:598:"It seems to me they'd be able to get a lot more metadata for their recommendation engine if they worked on allowing multiple personas per household account.

A more direct comparison per 100 million miles pits driving&#x27;s 1.27 fatalities and 80 injuries against flying&#x27;s lack of deaths and almost no injuries, which again shows air travel to be safer.&quot;[1] I thought everybody knew that airline travel is by far the safest form of travel.[2]<p>The basic issue about self-driving cars is that setting the standard of performance at &quot;better than most human drivers most of the time&quot; is a moderately low technical bar to clear, but would still result in a HUGE reduction of deaths, injuries, and damage to vehicles and roadside property.

Its tempting to think its because the people who use them dont care  just like the people who make them.&quot;<p>I am certainly a big believer in &quot;giving a damn&quot; about design and code. I completely believe that people &quot;feel&quot; the care that went into a product. I myself have agonized over a detail without any direct evidence that anyone, anywhere, would ever notice or care.<p>But I&#x27;m not sure this type of dismissive talk is the right way to relay the message. There are objects that are intended to fulfill specific requirements and budgets. Apple has the luxury of selling high-end products to people, like me, who are lucky enough to afford (unsubsidized) $600 phones. We take it for granted, but that&#x27;s not the norm for a bunch of great people.<p>There&#x27;s an office chair at Staples that is uglier than the chair I sit in. The materials simply don&#x27;t compare. But then neither would the price. There are people who just need a damn chair, and don&#x27;t have a bunch of money to afford a &quot;non-anonymous&quot; chair designed by somebody who &quot;cared.&quot; In fact, to the contrary, I&#x27;m certain the designer of the cheap chair appreciates his or her job, is trying to provide for a family, and would care not to lose their job.<p>Elon Musk made a similar comment. He said the actual cost to the manufacturer of a car in terms of product design is negligible. You could design the most beautiful car in the world without dramatically changing the sticker price for the finished product. So maybe Kia should go for it: spend millions of dollars per year and put together the best design shop the industry has ever known! Design an incredible new studio for them to work in. Give them the best tools. A completely new prototyping facility to print their designs. Hire color consultants to get the paint <i>just</i> right.<p>And then tell them they can only use the materials and manufacturing process of today&#x27;s $12,000 car, and somehow ensure the incredible demand for the most beautiful car ever conceived did not impact the price in any way.<p>Is it any wonder Tesla, despite Musk&#x27;s claims, is working his way from the top of the market, and not the bottom?<p>Tim Cook said last year something similar with regard to Android tablets. He said those tablets are collecting dust (my cheap, $199 Nexus 7 is not). If a parent really cared about their children&#x27;s education, they would opt for a more expensive iPad because it has better children&#x27;s apps (probably true right now).<p>This is the same line of communication that Ive demonstrates here. To me, it&#x27;s dismissive. I actually love my little daughter a whole bunch. I&#x27;m crazy about her. I don&#x27;t measure that love in dollars, and I actually think a cheaper, more durable Nexus 7 is the better option for her to play with right now.<p>Apple&#x27;s communications are borderline dismissive to people who are less fortunate and less lucky. I don&#x27;t think that&#x27;s intentional, because they are full of wonderful people, but I wish they would be more careful in their communication.

So what if he does something crazy such as open sourcing the design of his re-usable rocket, with the condition that anyone who uses pieces or the entirety of the design has to give back the improvements as well. I'm not sure what effect this would have on his company. It might push him to focus even more on execution, but I think it would also greatly accelerate this space flight race.<p>The good thing about this is that any future rocket or spacecrafts that would use at least some of the ideas in that design, would be forced to open source everything else.

Our current socioeconomic system rewards convincing others to depart with their money in the quickest way possible. Ponzi-schemes, marketing, financial trickery, etc. are the preferred methods.<p>Why do we see so many get rich quick startups (to the dismay of Sam Altman and YC) instead of fusion startups?<p>Because that&#x27;s the most rational way to succeed in today&#x27;s economy. You&#x27;d have to be an idiot to waste your time trying to build a working fusion reactor in your basement when you could just code up a photo sharing app and get acquired for billions. That&#x27;s why we all idolize Elon Musk; he&#x27;s only ever tackled difficult industries. How much easier would it have been for him to have made a Facebook, Instagram, etc. clone and become an investor just like the rest of his cohort of successful entrepreneurs?<p>Look gang, we have to stop lying to ourselves. YC and VCs are great for startups that require a few laptops and a bunch of determined programmers. They really are not suited to decade long research projects which have produced such things as: Multi-stage rockets, genetic sequencing, computers, the Internet, fission reactors, etc.<p>I love the startup culture, hacker culture and the sheer spirit of creativity and determination it espouses. But serious science and technology research is very expensive, very long term, and financially extremely risky. That&#x27;s why in the last century, it has almost exclusively been financed by governments under threat of war (WWI, WWII, Cold War).<p>Thiel prescribes deregulation and Libertarian governments as a solution to the failure of Big R&amp;D. I think he is wrong, precisely because of the last hundred years. Big R&amp;D is expensive and risky, and requires a very long commitment timeline for results. Corporations cannot and will not bear the financial risk of long term research. Neither will individuals or investors.<p>Thus, I propose the only solution that has any precedence: Big R&amp;D as a government mandate. Much like education, healthcare, and social benefits, Big R&amp;D must become a central pillar of a modern society. I envision a Cold War era science race between nations, research labs, and individuals, but in the spirit of science, not war.<p>Research would be a continuous national challenge, much like the Apollo project under Kennedy, but encompassing all of the sciences and continuing past a single administration. There would be work at every level for citizens in the nation&#x27;s research industry to slowly offset the losses incurred by automation. When all basic needs are met by a very efficient, very high tech and mostly automated free market system, research would become our  generator of economic activity. It would provide a consistent safety net for citizens exiting the free market, and prepare them for an eventual return if the opportunity arises (e.g. a new technological breakthrough is ready for the market).<p>Think of research labs like Bell Labs or Xerox PARC, but government funded, intertwined with a cutting edge educational platform (e.g. edX), and in every municipality.<p>In conclusion, I think the free market has done all it can for research. Capitalism is great at providing needs and wants very efficiently in the short term and making incremental technological progress, but is terrible for making big leaps by solving very hard problems that have substantial capital requirements.<p>For that, we have to look back to our previous successes in Big R&amp;D.";s:12:"story_author";s:7:"digisth";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"30";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"8337460";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:17;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"134";s:14:"comment_author";s:5:"FD3SA";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"6302375";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:2:"70";s:12:"comment_text";s:1214:"This is one of the few cases where this is worth repeating: correlation is not causation.<p>PG is definitely one of the foremost researchers in the realm of entrepreneurial success factors, but it is important to step back for a moment when analyzing such things as verbal accents and &quot;Zuckerberg likeness&quot; correlating with failure and success, respectively.<p>Just as Noam Chomsky criticized Peter Norvig because of his focus on statistical methods versus fundamental models, I would suggest that inferring success based on statistical observation without an underlying model can become a confusing and unrewarding process.<p>Statistics is a tool to test fundamental models, not a model to explain phenomena all in itself. As such, I would guess that founder success is more likely based upon mundane traits such as intrinsic motivation, intellect, experience, access to capital and key personnel, and most importantly, luck.

You prove your theorems more or less by typing out the proofs and the system mechanically verifies that each step in your proof is sound. I&#x27;ve used Coq and I&#x27;ll be honest. This is unquestionably a solid way to prove things about your program but it is too much of pain to expect this to have significant adoption in the &quot;real&quot; world.<p>In the hardware world, there&#x27;s been a lot of progress in automated verification thanks to modern model checkers [1,2] (which incidentally build on modern SAT, and in some cases SMT, solvers [3-6]). The nice thing about model checkers is that you just specify the property you want proven and let the verifier crunch away and it will (hopefully) come up with a proof or a counterexample. This has been successful enough that there are companies like JASPER and OneSpin which make money by selling hardware companies formal verification tools.<p>I worked with JASPER&#x27;s tools in the recent-ish past and one of the big things they seem to have done is make the tool much more usable. With the JASPER tool, it was much less of a pain to configure the model checker, abstract away parts of the design, keep track of the properties specified and proven, examine counter example traces and so forth than I was expecting. A lot of this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t get done in academic tools like ABC because it doesn&#x27;t count as research. But such improvements are extremely important if you want to push adoption of formal tools in an industrial setting. And from what I can see the emphasis on usability seems to paying off for JASPER.<p>Model checking in software has been less successful because the state explosion problem is much more pronounced but there have been notable success stories like Microsoft Research&#x27;s SLAM project [7]. And I definitely think there is an opportunity here to build upon the algorithmic progress in automated verification in order to build tools that are much usable in a software setting.<p>[1] <a href="http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bradleya/ic3/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecee.colorado.edu&#x2F;~bradleya&#x2F;ic3&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/abc.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~alanmi&#x2F;abc&#x2F;abc.htm</a><p>[3] <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.princeton.edu&#x2F;~chaff&#x2F;zchaff.html</a><p>[4] <a href="http://minisat.se/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;minisat.se&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fmv.jku.at&#x2F;picosat&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href="http://z3.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;z3.codeplex.com&#x2F;</a><p>[7] <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;projects&#x2F;slam&#x2F;</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"dllthomas";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7618406";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:4;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"141";s:14:"comment_author";s:5:"m0nty";s:10:"comment_id";s:6:"210073";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:476:"&#62; Voted most likely to succeed, when I should have been voted most likely to help ABC develop killer products.<p>You'll sound like an utter nob if you write like that.

However, Flushing is a mixture of Chinese people who came to the city during the 70&#x27;s and a new wave of immigrants in the 90&#x27;s and 00&#x27;s. So you have a eclectic mix of Chinese people who work in restaurants, aren&#x27;t as educated and also the sons and daughters of kids who were brought up in the old-timers old school Chinese household who worked their way up through the restaurant chains and became owners and sent their kids to good colleges. The old timers&#x27; culture and attitude closely resembles Hong Kong and Taiwan.<p>Group b) are the INTJ and class-A personalities. There&#x27;s a good mixture of both ABCs (American Born Chinese) and FOBs (first generation) in this crowd. A lot of my friends in this group are very ambitious and try to climb the management ladder by either obtaining a prestigious business degree (e.g., going to Wharton) or by working very long hours or by working on guangxi. As a result, socializing is very superficial. Some of the people I kept in touch since college or hang out with on weekends, I find that I hardly really know them at all; they best represent the &#x27;jing&#x27; of Chinese people as in Shanghai and the Mainlander attitude of always being calculating for self-preservation.<p>Group c) are generally the more Americanized Chinese people as they work in non-traditional fields. Although the degree varies depending on where they grew up and their upbringing. You might find some Asian Americans are willing to hang out with both Americans and Asians; some will only hang out with Asian Americans but no international Asians; some will not hang out with any Asians at all. The best way to describe this is the attitude of certain Hong Kongers toward Mainlander immigrants in Hong Kong, some will accept them, some think that they are superior because of their Euro-centric upbringing despite the fact that we all are Chinese.<p>But in general, everyone is very nice in NYC as it is an very international city.

I need a bit of advice as my research on google has not cleared my doubts.
I am based out of Hong Kong as a C++ and Java developer (10 years exp) and my company (an Investment Bank) has decided to move my role to New York. I have persuaded my bosses to relocate me to NYC and they have agreed. Though the HR talks have not yet happened regarding salaries, i would like to prepare and set mine and their&#x27;s expectations.<p>After a lot of research on google&#x2F;glassdoor&#x2F;etc, i have come to the following conclusions:
1. I might not get the best market salaries (Asian&#x2F;NYC being high cost center&#x2F;non native English speaker&#x2F;first timer to USA&#x2F;etc)
2. I should range my salary expectations in a range of 130K-150K just to be safe in the zone and not miss out on the job. Is this fair?
3. I have no option but to work in NYC and live in NJ. It seems that this is the sanest thing to do.
4. Taxes being high compared in NYC, I can safely assume 40% of my salary being cut. So that leaves me in a range of 78K-90K after tax. Assuming my rental will be around 2k and monthly expenses around 1k, that would leave me with 42K-54K. This i believe should be more than enough.
5. My life-work balance might go for a toss given that longer hours are the norm in NYC (Wall Street). Am i right?
6. Given that i will be moving to USA on an L1 B visa? (not a senior management guy) i can apply for a GC (as in Green Card, not the other GC) as soon as i join and get it in around 2-3 years. Am i right?<p>My preparation for my move has not yet started and i am sure that i will have more questions. Since i have no one in USA (friends&#x2F;family&#x2F;etc) i am completely reliant on YC.<p>Please let me know on the above points and if any of my assumptions are wrong.

I do interviews at a large Internet company, and one of my goals--one of the goals that I've been trained to seek--is to ensure that the candidate, no matter how bad, walks away from the interview feeling good about himself/herself and the company.  If you're doing really poorly in an interview, I'll toss you some easier questions than I normally give, because I have all the information I need, and I don't want you to have a negative experience with my company.  You may have felt good about the phone screens, but the most likely explanation for the two companies that didn't bring you onsite is that you didn't actually do well enough to justify additional interviews.

Read CS theory books, create and modify open source projects, solve fun programming puzzles: sharpen your skills and--no matter what your level of competency--your prospects will improve.<p>[0] <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"up_and_up";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"61";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"3351699";s:10:"story_text";s:4263:"TL;DR version: When developer talent sends you an email, you fail to reply!!!<p>==========<p>Full Version:<p>To all the startups and companies whining about lack of developer talent, I call your bluff.<p>I ran a little experiment over the last 60 days. I sent emails to ~50 different companies (some well-known, others unknown) that were looking for "Sr. Developers", particularly Ruby devs, as found on the major developer job sites (stackoverflow, Dice, Indeed, 37signals etc). I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting. I also picked companies that most closely matched my skillset. In my email I introduced myself and included my resume. Here is how I am represented in the email (paraphrased from actual text, ):<p>Given: X &#62; 7 &#38; Y &#62; 4,<p>"Sr. Level Developer, with X years exp. Y years of prof exp with Ruby.

You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc". If you think of "Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting";}i:15;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"gkefalas";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"1038662";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1830:"In terms of medical advances, there may not have been any major blockbuster disease cures found, but there were several very important advances &#38; innovations.

By sketchy, I mean that they may offend someone of a particular set, but are otherwise (in my opinion) brilliant executions that I'm proud of. I've never done anything illegal, and I like to think I have a solid base of ethics.<p>For example, when I was around 17, I picked up a trademarked domain for a popular music group from expiry (they didn't own it prior, was just a holding page for non-related topic). I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for "bling" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate. I offered email service, networked with other hip hop sites, and made about $100k from adsense before I was graciously C&#38;D'd and handed the name over.<p>Most recently I cofounded a project that was covered on the sites of TIME, CBS, Business Insider, Gawker, and pending an ABC News article. It made the front page of HN as well (thanks guys). That site was Price Of Weed, where we crowdsource and share information about the price people pay for marijuana. Possession is still illegal in most of the world; its easy to assume I'm some sort of stoner/drug pusher because I'm associated with this project, but in reality I don't smoke much at all.<p>Now I'm a biz guy and probably won't be applying to jobs at big corporations. I'd really like to work for a startup, which I believe would be less judgmental and more accepting of my project history. If you were me, would you stick these projects on your resume?

Forcing people into Procrustean categories more narrow than &quot;citizen&quot; for the people of one country builds division in the country and keeps people from treating their neighbors humanely as their fellow human beings. That kind of categorization was wrong and a moral outrage in the days of Jim Crow legally enforced segregation and it is still a bad idea today, even to correct the previous wrong.<p>I care about this issue deeply. I&#x27;m a baby boomer, which is another way of saying that I&#x27;m a good bit older than most people who post on Hacker News. I distinctly remember the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated--the most memorable day of early childhood for many people in my generation--and I remember the &quot;long hot summer&quot; and other events of the 1960s civil rights movement.<p>One early memory I have is of a second grade classmate (I still remember his name, which alas is just common enough that it is hard to Google him up) who moved back to Minnesota with his northern &quot;white&quot; parents after spending his early years in Alabama. He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was &quot;Negroes&quot;), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. He made me aware of a society in which people didn&#x27;t all treat one another with decency and human compassion, unlike the only kind of society I was initially aware of from growing up where I did. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn&#x27;t shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC) affirmative action program. (To me, the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don&#x27;t.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;Afro-American&quot; or &quot;black&quot; was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, &quot;What do you want to be called, &#x27;black&#x27; or &#x27;Afro-American&#x27;?&quot; His answer was, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be called Henry.&quot; Henry&#x27;s answer to my classmate&#x27;s innocent question really got me thinking. Why not treat all of my neighbors as individuals, one at a time?<p>And anyway I&#x27;ve seen this issue go wrong for people in other countries. Also in my childhood, in the other state I lived in growing up, I had a classmate in the early 1970s who would get on the school bus each day wearing a button that said &quot;Serb Power.&quot; I thought that was very strange, because I knew my history well enough to know that Serbia hadn&#x27;t been an independent country since Yugoslavia was formed after World War I. And, anyway, he was living in the United States and had been born here, so why was he so concerned about Serb power? We all found out during the early 1990s how crazy many people in Yugoslavia were about former historical grievances, which made that country disintegrate and killed many innocent people born long after the grievances should have been forgotten.<p>Most reporting to the federal government about &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; is based on the U.S. Census bureau definitions for ethnicity and race categories, which in turn are based on regulations from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which were announced on 30 October 1997<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitehouse.gov&#x2F;omb&#x2F;fedreg_1997standards</a><p>to take effect no later than 1 January 2003 for data collection by all federal agencies. You can look up the detailed category definitions on the website of the United States Bureau of the Census. As the Census Bureau itself notes,<p>&quot;U.S. federal government agencies must adhere to standards issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in October 1997, which specify that  race  and Hispanic origin (also known as ethnicity) are two separate and distinct concepts.  These standards generally reflect a social definition of race and ethnicity recognized in this country and they do not conform to any biological, anthropological, or genetic criteria.  The standards include five minimum categories for data on race:  &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native,&quot; &quot;Asian,&quot; &quot;Black or African American,&quot; &quot;Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,&quot; and &quot;White.&quot;  There are two minimum categories for data on ethnicity:  &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; and &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino.&quot;  The concept of race reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify.  Persons who report themselves as Hispanic can be of any race and are identified as such in our data tables.&quot;<p><a href="https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.census.gov&#x2F;faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191</a><p>It&#x27;s politics all the way down.

Imagine trying to get to grips with a Unix shell, if you had no concept of files or directories. In such a scenario, even a simple command like "cat" would seem incomprehensible.<p>If you'll indulge me, I'd like to propose a thought experiment.<p>* * Designing a patch database * *<p>Consider you're responsible for administering a busy open source project. You get dozens of patches a day from developers and you find it increasingly difficult to keep track of them. How might you go about managing this influx of patch files?<p>The first thing you might consider is how do you know what each patch is supposed to do? How do you know who to contact about the patch? Or when the patch was sent to you?<p>The solution to this is not too tricky; you just add some metadata to the patch detailing the author, the date, a description of the patch and so forth.<p>The next problem you face is that some patches rely on other patches. For instance, Bob might publicly post a patch for a great new scheduler, but then Carol might post a patch correcting some bugs in Bob's code. Carol's patch cannot be applied without first applying Bob's patch.<p>So you allow each patch to have parents. The parent of Carol's patch would be Bob's patch.<p>You've solved two major problems, but now you face one final one. If you want to talk to other people about these patches, you need a common naming scheme. It's going to be problematic if you label a patch as ABC on your system, but a colleague labels a patch as XYZ. So you either need a central naming database, or some algorithm that can guarantee everyone gives the same label to the same patch.<p>Fortunately, we have such algorithms; they're called one-way hashes. You take the contents of the patch, its metadata and parents, serialize all of that and SHA1 the result.<p>Three perfectly logical solutions, and ones you may even have come up with yourself under similar circumstances.<p>* * Merging patches * *<p>Under this system, how would a merge be performed? Let's say you have two patches, A and B, and you want to combine them somehow. One way is to just apply each in turn to your source, fix any differences that can't be automatically resolved (conflicts), and then produce a new patch C from the combined diff.<p>That works, but now you have to store A, B and C in your patch database, and you don't retain any history. But wait! Your patches can have parents, so what if you created a 'merge' patch, M, with parents A and B?<p><pre><code>   A   B
    \ /
     M
</code></pre>
This is externally equivalent to what you did to produce C: patches A and B are applied to the source code, and then you apply M to resolve the differences. M will contain both the differences that can be resolved automatically, and any conflicts we have to resolve manually.<p>Having solved your problem, you write the code to your patch database and present the resulting program to your colleague.<p>* * A user tries to merge * *<p>"How do I merge?" he asks.<p>"I've written a tool to help you do that," you say, "Just specify the two patches you want to combine, and the tool will merge them together."<p>"Um, it says I have a merge conflict."<p>"Well, fix the problem, then tell the system to add your file to the 'merge patch' it's making."<p>Your colleague dutifully hacks away, and solves the conflict. "So I've fixed the file," he says, "But when I tell it to 'commit file' it fails."<p>"Remember, this is a patch database," you reply, "We're not dealing with files, we're dealing with patches. You have to add your file changes to your patch, and then commit the patch. You can't commit an individual file."<p>"What? That's not very intuitive," he grumbles, "Hey! I've added the file to the patch, but it tells me the merge isn't complete!"<p>"You need to add all of the files that have differences that were automatically resolved as well."<p>"Why?!"<p>"Because," you explain patiently, "You might not like the way those files have been changed. It needs your approval that the way it's resolved the differences is correct."<p>"Why to I have to re-commit everything my buddy has made?" he complains, "Seriously, I want to just commit <i>one</i> file.

There was no real focus on investigative journalism, or analysis of the actual statistics by news organizations. There was also the whole rigged ABC News broadcast, which they admitted later to faking. Toyota's Recall became the top most reported story in Jan-Feb 2010.  And IIRC, as the media hysteria was winding down, the NHTSA concluded the majority of unintended acceleration was driver error.<p>In Apple's case, they had made a weakspot into a visual accent. And Jobs mentioned their algorithms made things appear more dramatic than they were. Both of these things were probably dumb, but dumb-like-the-recessed-headphone-jack (gaffe), not dumb-like-the-Microsoft-Kin (flawed design). The software fix is already out and the hardware will probably get fixed next iteration (perhaps coated?) and isn't a big deal. Yet the media coverage greatly outpaced the issue, and again no mention of statistics or data.<p>There are a lot of parties interested in seeing these reputable companies take a dive.

You want to pay money to watch NBA games, but you can't.  The owners want money through ticket sales, so if you live in the "home market", you don't get to watch the game on TV.  But, the owners also want money from TV deals.  But they don't want your $20 to watch the game on TV, they want ABC's $3 billion (or whatever) for the right to charge you whatever ("watch these ads") to see the game.  So there is no actual incentive to give you what you want; there is only incentive to sell games to networks at as high a price as possible.  (Also, sell advertising, and modify the game's rules to ensure that there is extra advertising at the 7 minute and 3 minute mark.)<p>Basically, at one end of the equation is some dudes passing a ball around.  At the other end of the equation, is you watching that.  In the middle, of course, there are the middlemen, and they all want a huge cut for doing absolutely nothing.

You prove your theorems more or less by typing out the proofs and the system mechanically verifies that each step in your proof is sound. I&#x27;ve used Coq and I&#x27;ll be honest. This is unquestionably a solid way to prove things about your program but it is too much of pain to expect this to have significant adoption in the &quot;real&quot; world.<p>In the hardware world, there&#x27;s been a lot of progress in automated verification thanks to modern model checkers [1,2] (which incidentally build on modern SAT, and in some cases SMT, solvers [3-6]). The nice thing about model checkers is that you just specify the property you want proven and let the verifier crunch away and it will (hopefully) come up with a proof or a counterexample. This has been successful enough that there are companies like JASPER and OneSpin which make money by selling hardware companies formal verification tools.<p>I worked with JASPER&#x27;s tools in the recent-ish past and one of the big things they seem to have done is make the tool much more usable. With the JASPER tool, it was much less of a pain to configure the model checker, abstract away parts of the design, keep track of the properties specified and proven, examine counter example traces and so forth than I was expecting. A lot of this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t get done in academic tools like ABC because it doesn&#x27;t count as research. But such improvements are extremely important if you want to push adoption of formal tools in an industrial setting. And from what I can see the emphasis on usability seems to paying off for JASPER.<p>Model checking in software has been less successful because the state explosion problem is much more pronounced but there have been notable success stories like Microsoft Research&#x27;s SLAM project [7]. And I definitely think there is an opportunity here to build upon the algorithmic progress in automated verification in order to build tools that are much usable in a software setting.<p>[1] <a href="http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bradleya/ic3/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecee.colorado.edu&#x2F;~bradleya&#x2F;ic3&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/abc.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~alanmi&#x2F;abc&#x2F;abc.htm</a><p>[3] <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.princeton.edu&#x2F;~chaff&#x2F;zchaff.html</a><p>[4] <a href="http://minisat.se/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;minisat.se&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fmv.jku.at&#x2F;picosat&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href="http://z3.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;z3.codeplex.com&#x2F;</a><p>[7] <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;projects&#x2F;slam&#x2F;</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"dllthomas";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"12";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7618406";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:8;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"232";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"Jemaclus";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"6560445";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:6754:"Here&#x27;s where I think I diverge from most people on this topic. My personal view is that I think by the time you bring someone in for an interview, you should already know that they can code, whether that&#x27;s through code samples they provide or through Github accounts or whatever.<p><i></i>TL;DR; Don&#x27;t waste your applicants time or your own<i></i><p>## The Interview
Interviewing should have two parts, imo:<p>* Confirming that I actually wrote the code I sent you and know what it means<p>* Confirming that you want to sit next to me for the next six months<p>I can tell you right now that if I take time off my current job to go sit in your office for an interview and you ask me basic questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; or &quot;What&#x27;s the difference between a POST and a GET request?&quot;, I&#x27;m going to thank you for your time and walk right out.<p>Why? Because my Github profile, which is featured prominently on my resume, contains examples of both. Half my projects are MVC projects, and many of them use 3rd party APIs (or are even APIs themselves!). The fact that you&#x27;re asking me basic definitions means you didn&#x27;t even pay attention to the stuff I sent you, so you&#x27;re wasting my time and yours. You could have already figured this out ahead of time. Instead, you asked me to take time out of my day (probably during work hours) to ask questions whose answers I&#x27;ve already provided.<p>(Please note that this only really goes for non-entry-level positions. For entry-level applicants, such as kids fresh out of college, you may not have very many code samples to work with. That&#x27;s fine. In that case, send some problems for them to work on at home. Hopefully, these are dumbed-down but real-world problems your company has faced in the past.)<p>## Phone Screen (aka verifying authenticity)<p>The first thing you should do is take a gander at my Github profile or my code samples. Then you call me up at a prearranged time and ask me questions about that code. Make me prove that I wrote what I said I wrote.<p>* I noticed you made this combat simulator (www.bitfalls.com&#x2F;2013&#x2F;08&#x2F;autofight-php-job-interview-task-part-1.html). Walk me through your thought process.<p>* Your code appears to be a custom MVC. Why did you choose to go with a custom one versus say, CodeIgniter or Symfony?<p>* This project is an API for Nerd Nite scheduling. First of all, what&#x27;s Nerd Nite and why did you make an API for it? Second, explain how you scraped the data, organized it, and output the results.<p>The above three questions will give you way more insight into my programming style and thought process than &quot;What is an MVC?&quot;. Please. Don&#x27;t waste my time. As a senior engineer with 7+ years in the field, I shouldn&#x27;t need to prove the equivalent of my ABCs to you. It should be understood.<p>I personally would also skip the whole &quot;live coding&quot; thing via Stypi or whatever. Waste of time, imo. You&#x27;ve already got code samples and you can ask me as many questions as you want about it. I shouldn&#x27;t need to write code in front of you to establish my credentials.<p>## What about people who lie?<p>There are people who lie about their resume and their qualifications, but that&#x27;s exactly why you should tailor your questions to fit the code samples provided. If I don&#x27;t get excited about that code and I can&#x27;t eloquently explain why I did what I did or how it works, then maybe I didn&#x27;t write it after all. It also gives you an insight as to my personality: I clearly took time out of my day to write this code. Why? What prompted me to write an API for Nerd Nite schedules?<p>The answers to those questions should give you an idea of whether I can actually program or not. Questions like &quot;What is MVC?&quot; can be looked up in a dictionary. Explaining code samples is much more difficult.<p>## What next?<p>Once you&#x27;ve established that I wrote the code I said I wrote, then Step 1 of The Interviewing process is mostly done. Now you bring me into the office to determine Step 2 -- am I someone you want sitting next to you for 8+ hours a day for the next six months? Do I fit in with company culture?<p>You could give me a problem to solve on the spot, but hopefully it&#x27;s more of a higher level thing rather than a &quot;write code on a whiteboard&quot; thing. The reason I say this is because at this point you should already have seen my code. You should know by now that I can build a class. The question you need to answer now is: given an arbitrary problem, can I solve it or at least come up with a reasonable thought process?<p>Bonus points if it&#x27;s relevant to the job. (i.e., if your job never requires you to write binary trees from scratch, don&#x27;t ask the applicant to do so.)<p>## Finally<p>Between the phone screen (technical) and in-person interview (personal), you should have a good idea of whether you want me on your team or not.<p>Occasionally for small teams, you may decide that you need to know something about time, creativity, independence, and other similar qualities that you can&#x27;t really get from code samples. If this is the case, then I suggest doing the contract thing, where you give them an assignment on contract. Once the assignment is finished, you hire them or pay them for the work completed (or hopefully both).<p>I really, really, really despise whiteboard coding. I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s indicative of anything, and I think you will find a lot of false negatives (i.e., rule out good candidates) using the whiteboard method.<p>A few other thoughts:<p>* I should meet my potential future boss at the in-person interview<p>* I should meet at least one of my potential future coworkers<p>* Be respectful of my time. Most interviews take place during work hours, so I&#x27;ve taken time off work -- and probably lied to my boss about where I&#x27;m going! -- to meet with you. The least you can do is not waste my time.<p>* Be familiar with my resume and code samples. I took the time to write them, you should take the time to read them. It will answer way more questions about my abilities than a 20 minute quiz on technical terms will.<p>The more informal the in-person interview is, the better. The technical qualifications should already be accepted by the time I walk in the door. At this point, it&#x27;s a two way street as we figure out whether we want to work together. I&#x27;m interviewing you just as much as you are interviewing me.<p>(Note: These are just my opinions about how I interview others. It hasn&#x27;t failed me yet. On the other hand, almost every job I&#x27;ve ever interviewed for has completely wasted my time on that front.)";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"gameguy43";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"26";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"6559404";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:9;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"218";s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"m0nastic";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"5835172";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:4409:"People's answers to whether or not you need to learn CS fundamentals have a habit of being self-rationalizations, so be careful with what advice you take (I say as I'm about to give advice).<p>How useful things are in "the real world" varies greatly. The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"14";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"5834687";s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

Really. I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on. Either way, no one is forced into anything.<p>Couple of others useful links with details on this:<p>[0] <a href="http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/view/story.jhtml?id=534355695&amp;" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hreonline.com&#x2F;HRE&#x2F;view&#x2F;story.jhtml?id=534355695&amp;</a><p>[1] <a href="https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/tag/performance-review" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.adobe.com&#x2F;conversations&#x2F;tag&#x2F;performance-review</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"tmbsundar";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"16";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"7196536";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:14;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"70";s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"robbiet480";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"4719277";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:330:"This means that Disney now controls Marvel, Pixar, LucasArts, ABC, ESPN, A+E, Disney Channel plus all their own original content and of course the parks and merchandising rights for everything stated above.

And I don't want to demoralize you or ridicule the work done already. However, there are a number of problems with the implementation as it stands that make it a bad idea to ask for contributors at this stage:<p>1. There are no tests. How can I be expected to contribute to your project when there's no way I can ensure a change doesn't break existing functionality, or even works itself? Testing remote APIs is a bit of a hassle, but it's what mocking was made for. Short of signing up for multiple payment gateways, there's no current way to test any change I make.<p>2. No setup.py support. This will likely further limit the number of people who contribute as it increases the barrier to entry. A proper project structure is a relatively easy thing that saves you a ton of time in aggregate.<p>3. There is no coherent developer API. Why does XMLGatewayInterface exist if only one gateway uses it? Why isn't there a generic GatewayInterface that abstracts things further, for non-XML APIs? If you're not going to use ABCs or strict interfaces (like zope.interface), you should at least have well-formed documentation: most ivar conventions (Foo.API_BASE, etc.) aren't mentioned anywhere. Why are there exceptions in the lib module that are only used by one gateway (or none)?<p>4. There are a multitude of minor design decisions that, if followed by contributors, will likely cause you pain down the road. Using print for debug output, relative imports, random error handling, "entrapping" functions (why would a function take two optional parameters that are immediately checked for non-None status?), etc.<p>To be clear, I'm very glad you're working on thisit's a difficult (at least incredibly tedious) problem that I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate a Python solution for, myself included. But I don't think this is a very good time to be asking people to fork and contribute. You need a proper foundation built before trying to solicit contributions or you'll end up with a bunch of code you'll need to rewrite later instead of a comparatively small amount you should rewrite now.<p>As the library author, it's your responsibility to build a cohesive, general-yet-customizable, clear interface upon which people can build and test their own gateway drivers. If you do that, I promise you you'll have contributors in no time. It's exactly what we did with libcloud and we now support almost every cloud provider out there and even have a nearly API-compliant Java fork (just to lend some credibility to my rambling).";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"auston";s:19:"story_comment_count";s:2:"15";s:8:"story_id";s:7:"1863058";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:19;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:3:"788";s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"netcan";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"2643334";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:1956:"<i>Imagine a puddle waking up one morning and thinking, "This is an interesting world I find myself in  an interesting hole I find myself in  fits me rather neatly, doesn't it?

It's probably better suited for Silicon Valley in 2011 than New York 1997 or Curitiba in 2025. That shouldn't be a surprise.<p>That doesn't mean that Curitiba in 2025 is or is not a good place and time for a YC-like creature to exist. Certain types of people, investors, exits, consumers... make it a good place for certain types of founders abc to receive xyz in exchange for 123. India is very different and obviously the local version at its best would need some adaptations. Who knows what those are.<p>India's opportunities are lots of programmers. Talent available at very low costs. BTW, a local hirer would be able to get much better work for his $25 per hour than a New Yorker can get via elance. A 10 person team could potentially have a burn rate under that of a two person team in California. They have under-served markets. Ballooning markets and they are potentially better placed to understand under-served ballooning markets elsewhere.<p>Anyway, the two conditions that supposedly don't exist in India either do or don't actually need to exist in India depending on how you interpret them. I'm nowhere near an expert and they seem silly to me. (1)Big exits are international. Maybe Facebook would be more open to buying promising small team for $2.5m locally but once you get to $250m you're not going to be off the radar anywhere. (2) Why does the market need to be able to support 2-3 large players in <i>every</i> market. That's not a requisite. It needs to be able to support players in some markets. Luckily some (many) markets are international and can be accessed from anywhere.

The portability and interop is what's allowed people to keep migrating bits and pieces around to get something that works best for them.

"Web developers" is an extremely broad range of people, constantly evolving and churning and growing and changing.

An oft lamented consern is the difficulty in finding a co-founder.  Next to this is the regular discussion of what kind of founder to get, how to know you've got a good one... and all the possible problems that can happen when founders don't agree.<p>Well, I'm am old man at almost 40 and I've spent the last 18 years working for startups of less than 100 people, many of them successful, and almost all of them founded by more than one person-- and in almost all situations I knew at least one of the founders very well. <p>The number one thing that caused the unsuccessful companies to fail was fights between the co-founders.  And the successful ones-- were ones where the co-founders were very harmonious, because they had worked together for <i>years</i> before founding the company (multiple instances of this.)  Of course, there were also instances where co-founders had worked before and they still fought all the time.<p>A co-founder is not what you need, unless you already have one, and you have as good a relationship with them as the best relationship you've ever had with anyone in your life.  If you KNOW you're not going to have a problem, then great.<p>But for most of you-- those who don't know others who are as entreprenurial or don't already know someone - and have known for quite awhile that they would be a good co-founder-- you should not get a cofounder.<p>I know that PG says you need a co-founder, but while his intentions are good he's slightly off the mark.  Sure, its better to have more than one person in the company... and feel free to call your second thru fourth employees "co-founders" or give them "founders stock"... whatever.<p>But at the end of the day, if its your idea and you are the one who has decided to dedicate the next several years of your life to this project, then found the company and make everyone else who joins you an employee.<p>Employees can have good chunks of stock.  But you gotta have the authority question out of the way.  You have to be a good leader to run a company... and getting people in you don't know too well works much better when you both know they are employees (Even if they are called founders or whatever, how about "founding team" or "founding employees".) <p>Its  better for you to have the ultimate say and make a few wrong decisions, than for you and your co-founders to be fighting.<p>Nobody will ever have as much passion for the idea than the originator, and genuinely visionary people understand their idea on a level and in a context that nobody else will ever... thus you have to lead.  <p>Next to Venture Capitalist (who force companies to misallocate funds or go after longshots and abandon sure things), co-founders are the biggest reason companies fail.   And actually its even worse- when you have co-founders VCs like to get involved and start manipulating things. <p>Every time I've seen one founder pushed out or marginalized in favor of other founders by the VC firm, the company has not lasted 9 months after that. <p>For an example of the success of a single founder with founderr employees--look at Amazon.com.  Bezos is clearly the founder, and he got engineers in early, they got good stock, but they knew what they were.  The company would be much different if these employees had thought they were equal with the guy who had the vision.<p>So, those who are desperately seeking a co-founder.... stop... employees are much easier to find anyway.  And you can find ones who will take stock as compensation.  (Just don't be stingy-- I once was in talks with a company who was building out the founding team and offered me %1 stock plus a serious pay cut... I turned them down-- why take the real risk of a pay cut when there's no equity upside?)<p>Anyway... think about it-- and don't be held up waiting for that founder... start pressing forward without one and when you need to build your team, bring people on who are ready to follow you... and when their egos are not involved, things will go much better.<p>";}i:14;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";s:2:"97";s:14:"comment_author";s:5:"UK-AL";s:10:"comment_id";s:7:"6793810";s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:12:"comment_text";s:674:"I think programmers these days focus too much on having whizz bang technologies.<p>90% of successful project implementation is culture, good practices and so forth.<p>I&#x27;ve seen well run cobol projects, and badly run projects using all the latest trends.<p>It doesn&#x27;t really matter if your software is using Java, ruby or node.js.

I'm familiar with what happened there.<p>The article contains a few errors. One, the article claims Lehman owned lots of senior tranches, which lost value when default rates unexpectedly rose. That's incorrect. We could sell that stuff to pension funds and make money on it, so we did, and losses in that tranche didn't hurt us; it hurt the retirees.<p>Lehman got hit hard because they could not sell the highest risk tranches (referred to as "toxic waste"). But they made enormous fees on originating the CDOs, and the toxic waste paid high interest rates (20-30%), so Lehman reluctantly kept it on their balance sheet and constantly tried to sell it off to other people (most of whom were too smart to take it).<p>We tried to hedge the risk by shorting the mezzanine tranches (those were between the toxic waste and the senior AA or AAA tranches). If default rates went up, and we hedged correctly, the gains from the synthetic shorts would make up for the losses on the toxic waste subs.<p>But for a variety of reasons this wound up not working as well as expected. Particularly, the correlation of default rates between subprime and quality debt decreased substantially and unexpectedly, which means these shorts did not generate as much cash as was lost when the equity tranche tanked.<p>Also, for an amusing tangent, we had bomb-proof windows to the outside world on the trading floors. A fertilizer bomb could go off in Times Square and we'd still be trading.

Instead, I've been considering volunteering at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View to hang out with some elder geeks.  The Computer History Museum has a bunch of volunteer hardware/software hackers who restore vintage main-frames.  These are all really smart hackers who have spent decades in the tech business, and they are spending time in retirement doing geek stuff, because they love it.  These are the kind of people that I want to spend time with.<p>My team and I just moved to Silicon Valley this past year, and we're setting up out entire lives around the idea of having a series of start-ups.  We've driven a combined total of 12 thousand miles to get here.  We're set up financially so we can afford to iterate through start-up ideas without breaking the bank.  We have a great space to work in, and we're meeting a lot of cool people.  I actually talked with a man a few weeks ago who knew William Shockley of Shockley Semiconductor fame.  <p>Yeah, It's been a hard road just to get to Silicon Valley.  I'm sad that I didn't get in to the startup school.  But, I'm sure that I'm going to get a lot more rejections throughout my career as an entrepreneur.  If I wanted something easy, I'd choose a different career.   I'm doing this because I enjoy the challenge.  I'm doing this because I love technology.  I'm doing this because I love the game, and I'm in it for the long haul.

In two days, you have managed to create a community more fucked up than YouTube.<p>2. I started watching <i>because</i> of the outrageous stuff other viewers were doing.  When you go to curb the abuse, be aware of this.  Many of your viewers may be watching only because folks are doing stupid stuff like ordering pizza and making yCombinator pay for it.  Lose the hassles and you may lose the audience.<p>3. Reality TV shows succeed because they're <i>unreal</i>.  TV execs hype up and dramatize all sorts of conflict, because that's what gets viewers to tune in.  Nobody wants to see an ordinary person's life, because it's <i>boring</i>.<p>4. Who do you want to be - Anna Nicole Smith or Paris Hilton.  Your success in attracting viewers is proportional to how trashy you are willing to become.  Anna Nicole Smith and Paris Hilton remain media darlings because we can look at them and think "Wow, look how pathetic they are."  It makes us feel good about ourselves.  Unless you are similarly pathetic, people will not want to look at you.  Respectable people like Tim Berners Lee or Steve Wozniak seldom end up on the news.<p>5. If you <i>are</i> respectable and still choose to go on reality TV, you're setting yourself up to be torn down.  The justin.tv tagline is accurate: "An exercise in narcissism".  Narcissism is going to prompt abuse.  People think that since you've set yourself up on a pedestal, you've given them an opening to tear you down.<p>6. I initially had logged in watch the yCombinator dinner.  That proved impractical because of the technology: the audio quality was shitty, the video would randomly drop out, and you couldn't really see anything anyway.  Part of the problem for attracting a decent community is there's nothing for <i>decent</i> people to do.  That leaves it as a festival for troublemakers.<p>7. Have you guys not read Shirky?

Maybe for classic style VC fueled all or nothing deals, but for those more interested in living cheaply and bootstrapping something, as long as you have a line on the good tech people in your area, perhaps you can make a go of it.

There is only one thing that matters and PG was very clear on this. It is to come up with something that people will want and will be ready to pay for in some way (accept to view ads for instance).

An oft lamented consern is the difficulty in finding a co-founder.  Next to this is the regular discussion of what kind of founder to get, how to know you've got a good one... and all the possible problems that can happen when founders don't agree.<p>Well, I'm am old man at almost 40 and I've spent the last 18 years working for startups of less than 100 people, many of them successful, and almost all of them founded by more than one person-- and in almost all situations I knew at least one of the founders very well. <p>The number one thing that caused the unsuccessful companies to fail was fights between the co-founders.  And the successful ones-- were ones where the co-founders were very harmonious, because they had worked together for <i>years</i> before founding the company (multiple instances of this.)  Of course, there were also instances where co-founders had worked before and they still fought all the time.<p>A co-founder is not what you need, unless you already have one, and you have as good a relationship with them as the best relationship you've ever had with anyone in your life.  If you KNOW you're not going to have a problem, then great.<p>But for most of you-- those who don't know others who are as entreprenurial or don't already know someone - and have known for quite awhile that they would be a good co-founder-- you should not get a cofounder.<p>I know that PG says you need a co-founder, but while his intentions are good he's slightly off the mark.  Sure, its better to have more than one person in the company... and feel free to call your second thru fourth employees "co-founders" or give them "founders stock"... whatever.<p>But at the end of the day, if its your idea and you are the one who has decided to dedicate the next several years of your life to this project, then found the company and make everyone else who joins you an employee.<p>Employees can have good chunks of stock.  But you gotta have the authority question out of the way.  You have to be a good leader to run a company... and getting people in you don't know too well works much better when you both know they are employees (Even if they are called founders or whatever, how about "founding team" or "founding employees".) <p>Its  better for you to have the ultimate say and make a few wrong decisions, than for you and your co-founders to be fighting.<p>Nobody will ever have as much passion for the idea than the originator, and genuinely visionary people understand their idea on a level and in a context that nobody else will ever... thus you have to lead.  <p>Next to Venture Capitalist (who force companies to misallocate funds or go after longshots and abandon sure things), co-founders are the biggest reason companies fail.   And actually its even worse- when you have co-founders VCs like to get involved and start manipulating things. <p>Every time I've seen one founder pushed out or marginalized in favor of other founders by the VC firm, the company has not lasted 9 months after that. <p>For an example of the success of a single founder with founderr employees--look at Amazon.com.  Bezos is clearly the founder, and he got engineers in early, they got good stock, but they knew what they were.  The company would be much different if these employees had thought they were equal with the guy who had the vision.<p>So, those who are desperately seeking a co-founder.... stop... employees are much easier to find anyway.  And you can find ones who will take stock as compensation.  (Just don't be stingy-- I once was in talks with a company who was building out the founding team and offered me %1 stock plus a serious pay cut... I turned them down-- why take the real risk of a pay cut when there's no equity upside?)<p>Anyway... think about it-- and don't be held up waiting for that founder... start pressing forward without one and when you need to build your team, bring people on who are ready to follow you... and when their egos are not involved, things will go much better.<p>";}i:2;a:2:{s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:3;a:2:{s:15:"comment_ranking";s:1:"0";s:10:"story_text";s:1097:"This is a half-baked idea, but it's free!
