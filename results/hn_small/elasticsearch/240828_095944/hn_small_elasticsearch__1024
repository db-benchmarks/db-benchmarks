We made a decent antenna and now do over-the-air HDTV for our appointment viewing. It's gorgeous and free. We use Netflix DVD/streaming to get the rest of the content we watch. Netflix+Internet+OTA fulfills our needs at a much lower price point and much greater flexibility. The cable model needs improve to compete. It would be compelling for me with things like per-channel a la carte pricing and price parity between HD and SD service.

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:14;s:8:"story_id";i:5834687;s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

With "it" apparently a vast blackhole of time suck spent searching endless forums for conflicting advice for why basic hardware on random machine doesn't work right, or why xyz package failed to install or abc driver doesn't work right.<p>No thanks, I still haven't figured out how to get the 3 days of my life back trying to share some files over my home network last year when I installed ubuntu on my old (but perfectly serviceable) computer in my latest attempt at using Linux.<p>What didn't work out of the box?<p>- Mouse (stock Dell USB mouse), never did fix that, tried 3 different mice, dug up an old PS/2 mouse and made do with that, probably some obscure usb issue, but the usb hard drives and keyboard I had connected worked from the beginning<p>- NIC drivers (dunnah, some regular old built in 10/100 part on the mobo), took an entire day of my life to resolve, and it kept dropping connection requiring a reboot every 4-5 hours<p>- Video drivers (nvidia something or other), never did work right<p>- file sharing (I eventually got it to kinda work after hand editing a bunch of files and installing some older version of samba, really, what's the gui there for anyways?)<p>- Stopped seeing one of the hard drives on the second day, a reinstall of ubuntu (and all the other crap I had to do) fixed that<p>- X died for no apparent reason, reinstall again<p>- it refused to sync properly with my perfectly cromulent monitor so I was doing all this at 640x480, which works brilliantly when half of the gui controls are off the screen, I was prepared not to care if I could just get the NIC working and remote in<p>- after getting everything working (kinda, with gum and duct tape), ubuntu did some sort of update that blitzed the whole thing and I just gave up, I hadn't even really gotten to what I wanted to do with it.<p>As much as I really tried to get it to work, and I try one of these about once every year or so since 1996 with whatever is the hot distro of the moment, and I had no illusions that it would be as straight forward as Windows or OS X, I <i>did</i> expect things like <i>actually being able to use the computer enough to fire up a browser and search for solutions to minor configuration issues</i>. Every issue I had was literally a major configuration issue. I spent those 3 days with my MBP sitting next to me so I could look up help in various forums.<p>By comparison, I wiped the drive, installed Windows XP, most of it was spent waiting for the files to copy, I had a thumb drive with 4 drivers on it. After install I clicked setup.exe for each driver, rebooted a handful of times. Clicked each drive I wanted to share and set it to "share" and that system is still up and running...I think I've rebooted it 3 times since then. Total time spent? 90 minutes.<p>So if "it" is wasting a bunch of my time for absolutely nothing in return? I can't think of any other area in my life where I would allow that kind of user experience.<p>Imagine this was a car, and I had to rebuild the engine or the shifter nob or pedals or windshield or whatever just to drive it off the lot, and then I'd find out it wasn't compatible with every road I wanted to go on, unless I patched it with a different windshield, but when I did that the a/c stopped working. And the brake pedal would stop activating the brake system every 6 hours unless I turned the car off and restarted the engine. Bringing in my car for an oil change might make the doors or wheels stop working.<p>I have pretty low expectations of technology.

I don't think many people would argue with that, it's awesome. In fact, we use it at Zapier for pretty much everything (basic funnels, A/B testing, retention, engagement, etc...) and we haven't even reached our full potential with it yet. But I still have some pretty fundamental beefs with the state of analytics software in general.<p>About the article, the problem stems from the fact that proper analytics is hard and is (arguably) getting harder with more advanced packages.Shouldn't it be going in the opposite direction?<p>It is a lot easier to track discrete downloads or pageviews than some other, more insightful metric, so people will naturally gravitate to the cheaper metrics. Until this is reversed, bullshit metrics will reign.<p>Anyways, my beefs:<p><i>First</i>: how do you decide what data to send into the package?<p>The more data you send, the better (sure), but at a certain point you are just duplicating your internal datastore, so that is too much, right? But not enough and you'll miss a chance to understand a phenomena that you didn't predict seeing (isn't that the point?). After you decide, then you write a crapton of code to send it all (what about backfilling data when you want to track something new?).<p><i>Second</i>: once you are collecting the data, how do you know what metrics to actively track?<p>This is definitely existential, but it's back to the core problem: doing analytics properly is <i>hard</i>. Why couldn't the software let me define some properties about the <i>type</i> of app I am running and suggest some strategies (you have a subscription SaaS app? Try tracking paid plan retention, signup funnels, etc...). Maybe it could go even further with <i>reverse</i> funnels, as in: what events are the most important and work backwards. I could see some automation and discovery possibilities there.<p><i>Third</i>: do I really have to dig around trying to find something useful?<p>All the data is there, the software should <i>tell</i> me what is useful or interesting. It's definitely a hard problem, but I would throw money at software that could send me this email: "<i>Looks like users who experienced event "ABC" also performed your highest priority event "Signup" at a 13% higher rate. This observation is 99% confident.</i>" Of course, you'd need to investigate a littler deeper to see if that isn't just a fluke or something stupidly obvious (like: people who view a page signup at a higher rate than those who don't), but at least I might learn something.<p>I know this is certainly a pipe dream as of today, but I vow to shower someone with money if they can do this.<p>In my opinion, the next generation of analytics software won't just have more bells and whistles, it will fundamentally shorten the time to some sort of real "AHA!" insight.";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"billclerico";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:18;s:8:"story_id";i:4933958;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:13;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:742;s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"gfodor";s:10:"comment_id";i:7814346;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:1;s:12:"comment_text";s:273:"A.

You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc". If you think of "Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process. If you can't find talent, my guess is that you are probably failing in one or more areas above.<p>EDIT: Formatting";}i:17;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:147;s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"d0mine";s:10:"comment_id";i:6310422;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:3;s:12:"comment_text";s:1928:"From Itertools Recipes [6]:<p><pre><code>  def grouper(iterable, n, fillvalue=None):

We made a decent antenna and now do over-the-air HDTV for our appointment viewing. It's gorgeous and free. We use Netflix DVD/streaming to get the rest of the content we watch. Netflix+Internet+OTA fulfills our needs at a much lower price point and much greater flexibility. The cable model needs improve to compete. It would be compelling for me with things like per-channel a la carte pricing and price parity between HD and SD service.

Every issue I had was literally a major configuration issue. I spent those 3 days with my MBP sitting next to me so I could look up help in various forums.<p>By comparison, I wiped the drive, installed Windows XP, most of it was spent waiting for the files to copy, I had a thumb drive with 4 drivers on it. After install I clicked setup.exe for each driver, rebooted a handful of times. Clicked each drive I wanted to share and set it to "share" and that system is still up and running...I think I've rebooted it 3 times since then. Total time spent? 90 minutes.<p>So if "it" is wasting a bunch of my time for absolutely nothing in return? I can't think of any other area in my life where I would allow that kind of user experience.<p>Imagine this was a car, and I had to rebuild the engine or the shifter nob or pedals or windshield or whatever just to drive it off the lot, and then I'd find out it wasn't compatible with every road I wanted to go on, unless I patched it with a different windshield, but when I did that the a/c stopped working. And the brake pedal would stop activating the brake system every 6 hours unless I turned the car off and restarted the engine. Bringing in my car for an oil change might make the doors or wheels stop working.<p>I have pretty low expectations of technology. I don't expect things to "just work", but I do expect to have a couple pretty clear lines to resolve any issues, even if I have to get my hands dirty and change the spark plugs myself.<p>So if this is "it", no thanks.";s:12:"story_author";s:3:"lgv";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:15;s:8:"story_id";i:2645329;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:8;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:19;s:14:"comment_author";s:4:"tyre";s:10:"comment_id";i:5687523;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:6;s:12:"comment_text";s:747:"This sounds really awesome, but I cannot see this being really effective.<p>For individual channels, they can just make it extremely cost-prohibitive to purchase single channels.

I don't think many people would argue with that, it's awesome. In fact, we use it at Zapier for pretty much everything (basic funnels, A/B testing, retention, engagement, etc...) and we haven't even reached our full potential with it yet. But I still have some pretty fundamental beefs with the state of analytics software in general.<p>About the article, the problem stems from the fact that proper analytics is hard and is (arguably) getting harder with more advanced packages.Shouldn't it be going in the opposite direction?<p>It is a lot easier to track discrete downloads or pageviews than some other, more insightful metric, so people will naturally gravitate to the cheaper metrics. Until this is reversed, bullshit metrics will reign.<p>Anyways, my beefs:<p><i>First</i>: how do you decide what data to send into the package?<p>The more data you send, the better (sure), but at a certain point you are just duplicating your internal datastore, so that is too much, right? But not enough and you'll miss a chance to understand a phenomena that you didn't predict seeing (isn't that the point?). After you decide, then you write a crapton of code to send it all (what about backfilling data when you want to track something new?).<p><i>Second</i>: once you are collecting the data, how do you know what metrics to actively track?<p>This is definitely existential, but it's back to the core problem: doing analytics properly is <i>hard</i>. Why couldn't the software let me define some properties about the <i>type</i> of app I am running and suggest some strategies (you have a subscription SaaS app? Try tracking paid plan retention, signup funnels, etc...). Maybe it could go even further with <i>reverse</i> funnels, as in: what events are the most important and work backwards. I could see some automation and discovery possibilities there.<p><i>Third</i>: do I really have to dig around trying to find something useful?<p>All the data is there, the software should <i>tell</i> me what is useful or interesting. It's definitely a hard problem, but I would throw money at software that could send me this email: "<i>Looks like users who experienced event "ABC" also performed your highest priority event "Signup" at a 13% higher rate. This observation is 99% confident.</i>" Of course, you'd need to investigate a littler deeper to see if that isn't just a fluke or something stupidly obvious (like: people who view a page signup at a higher rate than those who don't), but at least I might learn something.<p>I know this is certainly a pipe dream as of today, but I vow to shower someone with money if they can do this.<p>In my opinion, the next generation of analytics software won't just have more bells and whistles, it will fundamentally shorten the time to some sort of real "AHA!" insight.";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"billclerico";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:18;s:8:"story_id";i:4933958;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:11;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:742;s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"gfodor";s:10:"comment_id";i:7814346;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:1;s:12:"comment_text";s:273:"A.

Much of its working capital has come from nearly half a billion dollars in low-interest rate government loans. It has just a few dozen dealers around the world." Elon Musk seems desperate to stay in spin mode about any article on the Model S that is less than laudatory precisely because he can't brag up his company by referring to market share or sales growth or other issues that most entrepreneurs refer to.<p>AFTER EDIT: I appreciate the kind reply that mentions that Tesla Motors reports fourth quarter results tomorrow (Wednesday 20 February 2013). That will be interesting reading. Of course I was referring to the kind of general statement that a president of a successful company can make along the lines of "We have a growing, profitable business, and the word of mouth from our customers in cold states speaks for itself." But that's not what I hear from Musk, but rather nit-picking about published reviews.<p>The comment below prompted me to look up some investor news about Tesla, and I found a Motley Fool blog post<p><a href="http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/this-weeks-5-dumbest-stock-moves-tesla-motors-inc-tsla-65147/" rel="nofollow">http://www.insidermonkey.com/blog/this-weeks-5-dumbest-stock...</a><p>commenting on the results of Musk's initial response to the New York Times review: "Tesla had to defend itself on this, but drawing more attention to the incident in a way that forces Tesla drivers to be patient through recharging stations, lighter on the accelerator, and focused on the most direct path from one destination to another doesn't sound like potent marketing material for a car that costs at least $60,000."";s:12:"story_author";s:13:"neuralnetwork";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:35;s:8:"story_id";i:5247932;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:15;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:211;s:14:"comment_author";s:11:"the_watcher";s:10:"comment_id";i:7431589;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:43;s:12:"comment_text";s:189:"I thought it was interesting (and a bit funny) to see powered exoskeletons on an RFS so close to Elon Musk&#x27;s companies, given the running joke about him being the real life Tony Stark.";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"StuieK";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:56;s:8:"story_id";i:7431209;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:16;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:123;s:14:"comment_author";s:9:"jimmcslim";s:10:"comment_id";i:8589347;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:3;s:12:"comment_text";s:585:"A great idea, but I wonder what Elon Musk&#x27;s ideas about addressing the possibility of the Kessler syndrome; collisions between orbiting debris at an exponential pace ultimately leading to the denial of safe orbits to humanity.<p>Given SpaceX this is clearly something he should be deeply concerned about, but is he addressing it in any way, or just adding to the problem?<p>I&#x27;d say he is having a positive impact with his focus on reusable rocket stages, therefore less debris in orbit... a cloud of micro-satellites (how manueverable?) might be going in the other direction.";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"ssclafani";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:20;s:8:"story_id";i:8588736;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:17;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:288;s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"pvnick";s:10:"comment_id";i:6844576;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:12:"comment_text";s:555:"SpaceX is the company that really makes Elon Musk a role model for me.

The fact that the OP&#x27;s daughter signed up for programming class because she wanted to impress her parent is truly a parenting win. Not just for programming, but <i>anything</i>, at that age.<p>2. I consider myself pretty open minded about gender diversity...but as I was reading the OP&#x27;s post, I completely assumed it was written by a programmer-father, until I got to the part where the OP describes being harassed. Still, the mental stereotype was so strong that when writing this comment, I kept having to not refer to the OP as the father of the daughter. The trolling that the OP describes is troubling. But it&#x27;s easy to be angry at the trolling, and raise awareness about it. Unfortunately, I think women in tech still have the much more difficult task of fighting pervasive, subconscious stereotyping and assumptions in the industry.<p>edit: 3. The OP treats the use of Visual Basic as an ancillary problem...and it is, compared to what her daughter had to put up. But yeah, VB, seriously?

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems. Not that those problems are unsolvable without it, but that they are much more easily solved (and in some cases able to be avoided completely).";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"rahilsondhi";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:14;s:8:"story_id";i:5834687;s:10:"story_text";s:1745:"I'm a 23 year old self taught developer.

I don't think many people would argue with that, it's awesome. In fact, we use it at Zapier for pretty much everything (basic funnels, A/B testing, retention, engagement, etc...) and we haven't even reached our full potential with it yet. But I still have some pretty fundamental beefs with the state of analytics software in general.<p>About the article, the problem stems from the fact that proper analytics is hard and is (arguably) getting harder with more advanced packages.Shouldn't it be going in the opposite direction?<p>It is a lot easier to track discrete downloads or pageviews than some other, more insightful metric, so people will naturally gravitate to the cheaper metrics. Until this is reversed, bullshit metrics will reign.<p>Anyways, my beefs:<p><i>First</i>: how do you decide what data to send into the package?<p>The more data you send, the better (sure), but at a certain point you are just duplicating your internal datastore, so that is too much, right? But not enough and you'll miss a chance to understand a phenomena that you didn't predict seeing (isn't that the point?). After you decide, then you write a crapton of code to send it all (what about backfilling data when you want to track something new?).<p><i>Second</i>: once you are collecting the data, how do you know what metrics to actively track?<p>This is definitely existential, but it's back to the core problem: doing analytics properly is <i>hard</i>. Why couldn't the software let me define some properties about the <i>type</i> of app I am running and suggest some strategies (you have a subscription SaaS app? Try tracking paid plan retention, signup funnels, etc...). Maybe it could go even further with <i>reverse</i> funnels, as in: what events are the most important and work backwards. I could see some automation and discovery possibilities there.<p><i>Third</i>: do I really have to dig around trying to find something useful?<p>All the data is there, the software should <i>tell</i> me what is useful or interesting. It's definitely a hard problem, but I would throw money at software that could send me this email: "<i>Looks like users who experienced event "ABC" also performed your highest priority event "Signup" at a 13% higher rate. This observation is 99% confident.</i>" Of course, you'd need to investigate a littler deeper to see if that isn't just a fluke or something stupidly obvious (like: people who view a page signup at a higher rate than those who don't), but at least I might learn something.<p>I know this is certainly a pipe dream as of today, but I vow to shower someone with money if they can do this.<p>In my opinion, the next generation of analytics software won't just have more bells and whistles, it will fundamentally shorten the time to some sort of real "AHA!" insight.";s:12:"story_author";s:11:"billclerico";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:18;s:8:"story_id";i:4933958;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:2;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:11;s:14:"comment_author";s:12:"disposition2";s:10:"comment_id";i:9577505;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:12:"comment_text";s:1173:"I feel like Spotify is regressing in terms of music discovery and usefulness in general.

I do interviews at a large Internet company, and one of my goals--one of the goals that I've been trained to seek--is to ensure that the candidate, no matter how bad, walks away from the interview feeling good about himself/herself and the company.  If you're doing really poorly in an interview, I'll toss you some easier questions than I normally give, because I have all the information I need, and I don't want you to have a negative experience with my company.  You may have felt good about the phone screens, but the most likely explanation for the two companies that didn't bring you onsite is that you didn't actually do well enough to justify additional interviews.

I sent emails to ~50 different companies (some well-known, others unknown) that were looking for "Sr. Developers", particularly Ruby devs, as found on the major developer job sites (stackoverflow, Dice, Indeed, 37signals etc). I mainly targeted companies that were potentially/maybe/sorta/kinda/probably/possibly able to accomodate some form of telecommuting/remoting. I also picked companies that most closely matched my skillset. In my email I introduced myself and included my resume.

You don't read or dont respond to emails!!<p>How can 40/50 companies or their recruiters not even respond to an email at all? Why heavily advertise a position only to not follow through! 
LESSON: Check the email box for resumes<p>2. You allow for big time gaps in your hiring process<p>The hiring process at some of the companies that contacted me was just strange. One day they ask me "when can we setup an interview?", so I respond right away. 4-5 days later they get back saying "Ok how about next week?". LESSON: Long delays in communication make me lose confidence in the process/the seriousness of your interest etc.<p>3. Weird extra steps<p>Some companies like to send riddle/puzzles/challenges etc, which is fine with me. This might be a barrier to some people that think its absurd. What does it prove? That your team spends lunch break browsing trickyriddles.com?  LESSON: riddle/puzzles/challenges might seem cool to you but might just seem like another hoop to me.<p>4. A cultural mismatch<p>"Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" - Nothing against any of that, but as married father of two, I have other concerns (what no ping pong table?) like "Compensation, Opportunity for Advancement, Great Benefits, Fast Growing, Opportunities to contribute/architect etc". If you think of "Xbox's PS3 Nerf guns Starcraft/Rock band competitions !!!" is an applicant deterrent, then I agree with your strategy. LESSON: not all programmers/developers fit the fold you are presenting, many of us are unique!!!<p>5. You dont hire telecommuters/remotes even if you say you do<p>This has been talked about ad nauseum...<p>Other potential reasons: Administrative snafus, HR general laziness, what HR?, the site's down, I want too much money, your company has a bad reputation, others?<p>So after 60 days I am still looking ;) but based on my simple research project, 80% of companies claiming to need developers are either nonserious or are too busy to even start the hiring process.<p>I know, this research project is flawed and anecdotal but maybe it can help you rethink/iron out any bugs in your hiring process.

We're a long way away from a real cure, but survival rates have never been higher.<p>- Incredible advances in arthroscopic &#38; noninvasive/outpatient surgery &#38; procedures: In 2004-ish I blew out the "terrible triad" of knee ligaments; my surgery scars are just little dots.

Really. I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it.

By sketchy, I mean that they may offend someone of a particular set, but are otherwise (in my opinion) brilliant executions that I'm proud of. I've never done anything illegal, and I like to think I have a solid base of ethics.<p>For example, when I was around 17, I picked up a trademarked domain for a popular music group from expiry (they didn't own it prior, was just a holding page for non-related topic). I built an unofficial fan site with pics, lyrics, and news content. It was also optimized towards adsense (20+% CTR), pushed affiliate sales for "bling" jewelry products and eventually signed a 1-year $1k/month advertising deal with my affiliate. I offered email service, networked with other hip hop sites, and made about $100k from adsense before I was graciously C&#38;D'd and handed the name over.<p>Most recently I cofounded a project that was covered on the sites of TIME, CBS, Business Insider, Gawker, and pending an ABC News article. It made the front page of HN as well (thanks guys). That site was Price Of Weed, where we crowdsource and share information about the price people pay for marijuana. Possession is still illegal in most of the world; its easy to assume I'm some sort of stoner/drug pusher because I'm associated with this project, but in reality I don't smoke much at all.<p>Now I'm a biz guy and probably won't be applying to jobs at big corporations. I'd really like to work for a startup, which I believe would be less judgmental and more accepting of my project history. If you were me, would you stick these projects on your resume?

If the area isn&#x27;t safe, do not even attempt to enter the scene. Fires can instantly flare up and engulf a room in seconds. Rivers can be so cold they cause shock upon entering the water and, in some cases, they cause cardiac arrest. Tiny pieces of broken glass can cause deep, sometimes life-threatening lacerations. An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment. Some of that equipment is located onboard a fire truck or an ambulance. Most of that equipment is usually found inside the operating room of your local hospital.

And then, as more people switch to them and the demand for oil relaxes even a little bit, the oil price can fall dramatically as well, until some of those alternative choices don&#x27;t seem as economical.<p>Even just a simple model like that can explain all sorts of brain-numbing conversational patterns.  Like the certainty that big oil has had the knowledge of clean, cheap energy and that they keep it secret to make money on oil... or that they&#x27;ll pump up oil prices to lure the alternative energy people to make business risks, and then purposely flood the market in order to put them out of business, etc.";s:12:"story_author";s:10:"tokenadult";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:15;s:8:"story_id";i:8386268;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:9;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:3504;s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"tokenadult";s:10:"comment_id";i:7820120;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:12:"comment_text";s:6442:"Volokh here is decrying the same kinds of policies that I decry, for many of the same reasons. Forcing people into Procrustean categories more narrow than &quot;citizen&quot; for the people of one country builds division in the country and keeps people from treating their neighbors humanely as their fellow human beings. That kind of categorization was wrong and a moral outrage in the days of Jim Crow legally enforced segregation and it is still a bad idea today, even to correct the previous wrong.<p>I care about this issue deeply. I&#x27;m a baby boomer, which is another way of saying that I&#x27;m a good bit older than most people who post on Hacker News. I distinctly remember the day that President John F. Kennedy was assassinated--the most memorable day of early childhood for many people in my generation--and I remember the &quot;long hot summer&quot; and other events of the 1960s civil rights movement.<p>One early memory I have is of a second grade classmate (I still remember his name, which alas is just common enough that it is hard to Google him up) who moved back to Minnesota with his northern &quot;white&quot; parents after spending his early years in Alabama. He told me frightening stories about Ku Klux Klan violence to black people (the polite term in those days was &quot;Negroes&quot;), including killing babies, and I was very upset to hear about that kind of terrorism happening in the United States. He made me aware of a society in which people didn&#x27;t all treat one another with decency and human compassion, unlike the only kind of society I was initially aware of from growing up where I did. So I followed subsequent news about the civil rights movement, including the activities of Martin Luther King, Jr. up to his assassination, with great interest.<p>It happens that I had a fifth-grade teacher, a typically pale, tall, and blonde Norwegian-American, who was a civil rights activist and who spent her summers in the south as a freedom rider. She used to tell our class about how she had to modify her car (by removing the dome light and adding a locking gas cap) so that Klan snipers couldn&#x27;t shoot her as she opened her car door at night or put foreign substances into her gas tank. She has been a civil rights activist all her life, and when I Googled her a few years ago and regained acquaintance with her, I was not at all surprised to find that she is a member of the civil rights commission of the town where I grew up.<p>One day in fifth grade we had a guest speaker in our class, a young man who was then studying at St. Olaf College through the A Better Chance (ABC) affirmative action program. (To me, the term &quot;affirmative action&quot; still means active recruitment of underrepresented minority students, as it did in those days, and I have always thought that such programs are a very good idea, as some people have family connections to selective colleges, but many other people don&#x27;t.) During that school year (1968-1969), there was a current controversy in the United States about whether the term &quot;Negro&quot; or &quot;Afro-American&quot; or &quot;black&quot; was most polite. So a girl in my class asked our visitor, &quot;What do you want to be called, &#x27;black&#x27; or &#x27;Afro-American&#x27;?&quot; His answer was, &quot;I&#x27;d rather be called Henry.&quot; Henry&#x27;s answer to my classmate&#x27;s innocent question really got me thinking. Why not treat all of my neighbors as individuals, one at a time?<p>And anyway I&#x27;ve seen this issue go wrong for people in other countries. Also in my childhood, in the other state I lived in growing up, I had a classmate in the early 1970s who would get on the school bus each day wearing a button that said &quot;Serb Power.&quot; I thought that was very strange, because I knew my history well enough to know that Serbia hadn&#x27;t been an independent country since Yugoslavia was formed after World War I. And, anyway, he was living in the United States and had been born here, so why was he so concerned about Serb power? We all found out during the early 1990s how crazy many people in Yugoslavia were about former historical grievances, which made that country disintegrate and killed many innocent people born long after the grievances should have been forgotten.<p>Most reporting to the federal government about &quot;race&quot; and &quot;ethnicity&quot; is based on the U.S. Census bureau definitions for ethnicity and race categories, which in turn are based on regulations from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), which were announced on 30 October 1997<p><a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/fedreg_1997standards" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.whitehouse.gov&#x2F;omb&#x2F;fedreg_1997standards</a><p>to take effect no later than 1 January 2003 for data collection by all federal agencies. You can look up the detailed category definitions on the website of the United States Bureau of the Census. As the Census Bureau itself notes,<p>&quot;U.S. federal government agencies must adhere to standards issued by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in October 1997, which specify that  race  and Hispanic origin (also known as ethnicity) are two separate and distinct concepts.  These standards generally reflect a social definition of race and ethnicity recognized in this country and they do not conform to any biological, anthropological, or genetic criteria.  The standards include five minimum categories for data on race:  &quot;American Indian or Alaska Native,&quot; &quot;Asian,&quot; &quot;Black or African American,&quot; &quot;Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander,&quot; and &quot;White.&quot;  There are two minimum categories for data on ethnicity:  &quot;Hispanic or Latino&quot; and &quot;Not Hispanic or Latino.&quot;  The concept of race reflects self-identification by people according to the race or races with which they most closely identify.  Persons who report themselves as Hispanic can be of any race and are identified as such in our data tables.&quot;<p><a href="https://ask.census.gov/faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;ask.census.gov&#x2F;faq.php?id=5000&amp;faqId=191</a><p>It&#x27;s politics all the way down.

You prove your theorems more or less by typing out the proofs and the system mechanically verifies that each step in your proof is sound. I&#x27;ve used Coq and I&#x27;ll be honest. This is unquestionably a solid way to prove things about your program but it is too much of pain to expect this to have significant adoption in the &quot;real&quot; world.<p>In the hardware world, there&#x27;s been a lot of progress in automated verification thanks to modern model checkers [1,2] (which incidentally build on modern SAT, and in some cases SMT, solvers [3-6]). The nice thing about model checkers is that you just specify the property you want proven and let the verifier crunch away and it will (hopefully) come up with a proof or a counterexample. This has been successful enough that there are companies like JASPER and OneSpin which make money by selling hardware companies formal verification tools.<p>I worked with JASPER&#x27;s tools in the recent-ish past and one of the big things they seem to have done is make the tool much more usable. With the JASPER tool, it was much less of a pain to configure the model checker, abstract away parts of the design, keep track of the properties specified and proven, examine counter example traces and so forth than I was expecting. A lot of this sort of thing doesn&#x27;t get done in academic tools like ABC because it doesn&#x27;t count as research. But such improvements are extremely important if you want to push adoption of formal tools in an industrial setting. And from what I can see the emphasis on usability seems to paying off for JASPER.<p>Model checking in software has been less successful because the state explosion problem is much more pronounced but there have been notable success stories like Microsoft Research&#x27;s SLAM project [7]. And I definitely think there is an opportunity here to build upon the algorithmic progress in automated verification in order to build tools that are much usable in a software setting.<p>[1] <a href="http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bradleya/ic3/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecee.colorado.edu&#x2F;~bradleya&#x2F;ic3&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/abc.htm" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~alanmi&#x2F;abc&#x2F;abc.htm</a><p>[3] <a href="https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html" rel="nofollow">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.princeton.edu&#x2F;~chaff&#x2F;zchaff.html</a><p>[4] <a href="http://minisat.se/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;minisat.se&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href="http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fmv.jku.at&#x2F;picosat&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href="http://z3.codeplex.com/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;z3.codeplex.com&#x2F;</a><p>[7] <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;projects&#x2F;slam&#x2F;</a>";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"dllthomas";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:12;s:8:"story_id";i:7618406;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:12;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:356;s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"suprgeek";s:10:"comment_id";i:7485127;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:12:"comment_text";s:684:"This is tyranny sneaking up on us one &quot;No-XYZ list&quot; at a time.<p>They can put you on it for any reason (lets say you oppose one of the Govt. policies - Drone Bombings for example), you will be unable to find out why you are on said list or even if you are.<p>Since you cannot confirm that you are on said list you will not be able to get off it.

Really. I always have a smile on my face when my boss announces the dreaded annual review time in a meeting and then looks at me and goes &quot;Not you of course&quot;. Love the feeling that I don&#x27;t have to worry about that crap.<p>You may not like Adobe for many reasons but this move is definitely worth a welcome. It is high time companies stop this madness of &quot;annual performance reviews&quot; which really does not mean much.<p>&quot;&quot;The aim is to give people information when they need it rather than months after teachable moments have passed,&quot;<p>Exactly. You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on.

The majority of my students are experienced programmers, but no small number are new to programming beyond very simple stuff.   I&#x27;ve found that Python has a number of aspects that are ideal for first-time programmers:<p>- It&#x27;s dynamically typed.  Say what you want about static vs. dynamic typing, but this is one less thing that newbie programmers have to get right.  There&#x27;s no chance of an error when they say &quot;i = &#x27;abc&#x27;&quot;, if you&#x27;ve defined i to be an int.<p>- It&#x27;s interactive.  The fact that you can &quot;play&quot; with the language within the interactive shell is a huge selling point.  IPython and the IPython Notebook are easy to get working, and for people to work with.<p>- Python&#x27;s restricted command set and simple, regular syntax let you concentrate on ideas: Yes, many newbies to Python (and to programming in general) get confused by indentation, blocks, colons, and the like.  But they&#x27;re going to get confused by the syntax of nearly any language.  Python has a simpler syntax than most other languages, meaning that there&#x27;s less to learn, and less to remember.  This lets the new programmer concentrate on the ideas that they&#x27;re learning, or the implementation of what they&#x27;re doing.<p>- It&#x27;s cross platform.  The fact that people can use Python on any computer they like is a big selling point.<p>- You can easily teach object-oriented and functional-style programming.  Python is obviously object-oriented, but can also be used to introduce functional programming.  In this way, you can expose programmers not only to multiple paradigms in Python, but also in other languages.<p>- You can use it for real applications.  People are often surprised to discover that real-life applications are being written and used in this language that they&#x27;re learning, which seems so simple.<p>I&#x27;m sure that there are more reasons than these.  But let&#x27;s consider the alternatives that the article suggested:<p>- I would be hard-pressed to think of a <i>worse</i> first language than C.  You want to introduce people to the concepts of programming, which means abstractions and high-level thinking.  C forces you to think in terms of the computer and its memory, which is just the opposite.  The fact that it&#x27;s compiled to binary form, that you don&#x27;t have an interactive C shell, and pointers are just three reasons why I think that C would be a very bad choice.  Sure, everyone should learn C at some point -- although I often point out that I&#x27;m a much happier person since I moved to dynamic, high-level languages many years ago -- but if you want to teach the concepts of programming, C is going to require too much learning just to get simple things done.<p>- JavaScript has many good points for beginning programmers -- but the chief problem, in my mind, is the language&#x27;s syntax, which is far too inconsistent and forgiving&#x2F;flexible for newbies.  I think that someone coming to JavaScript from Python will have a very easy time; the mapping of data types is fairly straightforward, and even the notion of passing functions is pretty easy to get.  But the learning curve in JavaScript seems steeper to me than in Python, despite the obvious advantages of being able to work within a browser.";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"btimil";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:14;s:8:"story_id";i:7122163;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:16;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:70;s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"robbiet480";s:10:"comment_id";i:5999686;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:12:"comment_text";s:3795:"(latest info at bottom of comment)<p>ABC reports it was coming from Taipei, linked forum says Taipei.

The consensus seems to be that a lot of people say they go through their whole careers without ever using any of the things you learn in CS (for example, you'll hear a lot of "I've not once ever had to implement quicksort"). I don't doubt that these people are correct, it seems pretty apparent that you can certainly have a go at being a developer without knowing all the fundamental theory.<p>Some people seem to take this as a point of pride, however; like knowing those things would be a drag and a waste of time. I find this attitude perplexing, although I'll admit that it might just be a flaw in my wiring.<p>I want to know EVERYTHING. Literally, I want to know everything. This can't happen, obviously (both for reasons around the limits of time, and also my intellectual failings), so I try and prioritize.<p>If you decide that you really do want to learn all the fundamental stuff, I'm sure people will suggest all sorts of ways that they've been able to do so. Pick and chose the things that people say that seem appropriate to your case, but obviously, everyone learns things differently, so don't expect there to be a good foolproof path you can take.<p>What I've been doing (and keep in mind, I'm an idiot, although I hope slightly less of one every day), is really a brute-force approach.<p>First, I looked at the curriculum at a bunch of well-regarded CS undergraduate programs (I picked MIT and Stanford, mostly because in addition to being pretty well-regarded, both have a lot of material online). I looked at what their early intro CS classes looked like, what books they used, what the lectures looked like, etc.<p>For books and topics which overlap between schools, that's an easy choice as to what materials to use (for instance, it seems like almost everyone uses CLRS for algorithms, so you can pick that one and at least feel comfort knowing you're in good company. I actually used CLRS in school, so this second time around I picked up Skiena's algorithms book ((mentioned effusively by tptacek on here a number of times)) and have been going through that.<p>If you literally just pick out the books from the undergrad classes at a couple of good CS schools and read them completely (and do all the exercises), you'll be a good part of the way there. That's not to say you get the same experience as being there (you don't), but presumably taking four years to go enroll in an undergrad program isn't on the table as an option, so you're making due the best you can.<p>And yes, the real knowledge will come from actually using the stuff you learn in the books, so the whole time, be writing programs ("ABC"...Always Be...Computing).<p>After the third or fourth "level" of classes, is usually the time in undergrad where you then start to specialize. After the core curriculum, you'll find that not everyone takes every class, you just have some number of classes from the "CS bucket" that you have to take, and you pick from it based on schedule and interest. Here is where you have an advantage over people actually in school, however. You don't also have to be taking philosophy (although maybe you should, again, in my case I want to know everything, of which philosophy is a definite subset), so you can spend as much time learning as many things as you want.<p>Want to learn about compilers? Read a book and build the projects. Graphics? Networking, Functional programming (assuming the intro books were predominantly imperative), whatever you want.<p>Basically, learn as much and from as many topics as you want to.<p>That won't help you in the short term ace programming job interview questions (and to be honest, I'm not sure if anything can really be that helpful as a short-term solution).<p>Again, I want to reiterate, you can have a long and successful career as a software developer doing none of these things, but the one thing I'd say is that once you do have a good grasp of actual CS fundamentals, you'll probably be surprised by how much easier it is to solve problems.

What have other people done in this situation?<p>2) Are CS fundamentals really important in the real world? Does it depend on the position? What if you're a JavaScript engineer working with Backbone, browser performance, etc.<p>3) Recommended courses (online or offline) to learn CS?<p>Right now I'm reading Introduction to Algorithms by Cormen et al.<p>Example interview questions:<p>* Given an array of negative and positive numbers (eg -100..100), find groups of two that sum to zero. Now find groups of three. Now find all groups.<p>* Implement a function that takes an integer n, and returns the number of 1's in the binary representation of n.<p>* Implement a function that takes takes 3 (x,y) coordinates which define the vertices of a triangle, and a 4th (x,y) coordinate, as inputs. Return true if the 4th point falls inside the triangle defined by the first 3 points; false otherwise.<p>* Write an extract_word_series() function that takes a string and returns a 2d nested array where the inner arrays are a group of contiguous words.

Bravo. Unfortunately, the permalinking fails with this particular regex, or I'd include it here. The visualization is so large, it more than fills my large screen. Still, pretty cool to see it render instantaneously and to watch it match example text. The regex is described here: <a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~cameron/REX.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~cameron/REX.html</a>
It will match either text or XML markup (it's used to tokenize XML), so try example text like '&#60;div id="123"&#62;abc' or 'abc&#60;?xml target?&#62;'.<p>The JavaScript form of the regex follows:

his head in disgust.] Hackers, it's time for me to hack the discussion. You and your first world problems have NO IDEA how to fight for freedom. This is the wimpy way to protest whatever it is you are protesting. Unlike most people who post here, I have actually lived under a dictatorial regime that ruled a territory that later had a peaceful transition to democracy and legally protected civil rights. Anonymous or whatever the name of the latest Western hacktivist group is going about things all wrong.<p>If you really want to learn about effective popular action to bring about more freedom, point your Web browser to the Albert Einstein Institute publications<p><a href="http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationsde07.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.aeinstein.org/organizationsde07.html</a><p>and choose your language for titles like <i>From Dictatorship to Democracy</i> and <i>The Role of Power in Nonviolent Struggle</i> and others. Note that the main author of these publications has consulted with freedom movements all over the world and has had notable success in the Philippines, Thailand, Burma, and other countries, and is credited with much of the mobilization of the two-year-old Arab Spring movement.<p>Going after the United States Sentencing Commission website is beyond stupid. The federal sentencing guidelines were a helpful reform. Before they were adopted, on the example of Minnesota's sentencing guidelines, federal sentences were just about wholly indeterminate, making each judge could make up his or her own law of sentencing at trial. The Minnesota reform, which was the example for the federal reform, set up guidelines based on a "severity score" of the offense--so that for the first time legislative statutes from many different decades were compared as to the actual social harm resulting from each offense, based on community standards as of the time of the reform--and on a "criminal history score" of the offender, so that prison time was reserved only for the most dangerous repeat offenders. (Minnesota imprisons fewer convicted criminals than most states of the United States, being much like Scandinavia in this regard. Minnesota spends more dollars per prisoner but fewer dollars per taxpayer on its prison system than almost any other state.)<p>I know actual freedom fighters, that is publishers of opposition magazines and organizers of nonviolent protests, from Taiwan. Some of them experienced hard prison time while in the struggle for freedom, with family break up and ill health and the other consequences of imprisonment. But today they can look at a much freer country in their homeland than they grew up in. The biggest problem with website-defacing movements is their cowardice (no one in Anonymous seems courageous enough to go to prison) and lack of perspective (they complain about first world problems that they mischaracterize as important problems for the common people). It's time for the discussion on Hacker News to grow up and make more room for the real freedom fighters.";s:12:"story_author";s:13:"throwaway2048";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:29;s:8:"story_id";i:5119600;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:2;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:300;s:14:"comment_author";s:12:"jonnathanson";s:10:"comment_id";i:3462972;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:12:"comment_text";s:3029:"<i>"In one fourth-grade classroom I visited in New York City, students engaged in group work were forbidden to ask a question unless every member of the group had the very same question."</i><p>This is the essence of what's so destructive and horrifying about today's obsession with groups: the idea that everyone in the group is equal. Equal in talent, equal in work ethic, equal in drive, and equally entitled to being heard. And that the consensus of the group of purported equals is more important than the achievements of any of its constituent members.<p>The plain, and perhaps un-PC truth is that that's a load of hogwash. Some perspectives <i>are</i> better than others. Some people <i>are</i> smarter than others, or work harder, or are better read, or are more knowledgeable, or are more capable. Some creative visions <i>are</i> more correct than others, even if we imagine that it's not possible to be "correct" or "incorrect" in the praxis of creative expression.<p>Beyond these variances in ability or capability, we also encounter variances in style. As noted in the article, some people simply work best alone. Some disciplines -- writing, coding, art, etc. -- simply lend themselves well to conditions of quiet, relative isolation, and to long bouts of individual effort. That effort can be in service of a team, or as part of a team, but we shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that creating by committee is in some way ideal.<p>The creative output of a committee tends to revert to the average creative capability of the least creative member on the committee. Social psychological studies have borne out that fact, and anyone who's ever been on a design committee knows it from brutal experience.<p>That's not to say, of course, that group brainstorms and the like can't be productive. They certainly can be. But the people in the group are everything. They need to be very sharp and very creative. They need to get along well enough not to clash over personal matters -- but not so well that they simply agree with one another and revert into groupthink. But such groups are rare, and I dare say that they're the exceptions to the general rule. High-functioning creative teams are things of beauty, but they're not for everybody or every situation.<p>Finally, the <i>structure</i> of a group is critical to its success (or failure). Groups with well established divisions of labor tend to be more productive, and far less painful, than groups in which everyone does everything together. Ever try to write a school paper as part of a team? It was either a horrendous experience or a fantastic one. The horrendous teams sat down together and drafted every sentence, laboriously and unceasingly, by committee. The fantastic teams either divided up the sections by areas of interest or expertise, <i>or</i> delegated the task of drafting the paper to the person who expressed interest and professed great ability in writing -- allowing everyone else to do research, discuss and debate the topics, and so forth.";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"user02138";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:19;s:8:"story_id";i:3462439;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:3;a:9:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:57;s:14:"comment_author";s:10:"dougmccune";s:10:"comment_id";i:8132863;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:12:"comment_text";s:1037:"Trying to compare against the published schedule isn&#x27;t all that useful.

However, if a bus is supposed to be running every 12 minutes, that&#x27;s the number you can plan around (or use to benchmark the performance of a bus line). So instead of trying to show how the times compare with the theoretical schedule I think this would be more useful to show how the buses deviate from the planned interval. If I know it&#x27;s a 12 minute bus that means I should never have to wait at any given stop for &gt; 12 minutes. If I&#x27;m standing there for 30 minutes, then the bus service is failing me.<p>It would also be useful to color code the historic tracks based on which trips ended up taking something like &gt;10% or 20% longer than the planned time.

My answers to the two basic questions on threat modeling: &quot;What&#x27;s the likelihood of a threat against the journal would be?&quot; and &quot;What would happen if the threat actually happen&quot; would be &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; and &quot;I hope I&#x27;m old enough&quot;. On one hand, I&#x27;ve no reason to believe that my info would be of anyone interest. On the other hand, I&#x27;d rather not find out whether anyone does.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about it for a bit, and the most secure way seems to be getting a secondary machine without network access, and just write the journal there. This approach has several problems:<p>- Collecting data: I&#x27;d have to actually transfer data I got from another machine to this one, via some air gap methods. This seems way overboard to me.<p>- Backup: regular backup won&#x27;t be a viable options, especially for redundancy in term of geography.<p>All in all, I&#x27;d prefer to have some security&#x2F;encryption scheme that I can use on a normal machine. Of course, the trade off will be security. I&#x27;m willing to accept that if I managed to be a named target of a 3 letter agency on a 20 person lists, they will successfully mount an attack for the data (I wouldn&#x27;t be able to stop them, either way). But beyond that, I&#x27;d like the data to be as secure as possible.

talk, but I run into this belief a lot, and want to make a point.<p>I see little evidence here that Collins-Sussman has finally understood
DVCS as a social entity, although he certainly seems to have the
technical details down.  The strongest argument for DVCS--any
DVCS--that I have found is the periodic fights over "committer access"
or project direction generally for projects like NetBSD, XEmacs,
gcc/EGCS, or glibc/eglibc disappear.<p>I've seen more times than I can conveniently remember a <i>perception</i>
of a cabal of committers who communicate exclusively with each other.
This looks a lot like the structure of some sort of conspiracy, even
though that is rarely the purpose.  Even when it is, it's usually
trying to work around some productive but extremely difficult person
like Ulrich Drepper or Theo de Raadt.<p>DVCSes have the critically important property that there is no longer
any inherent <i>technical</i> center of development but that the <i>social</i>
center of development is retained (usually).  So while there is a
technical hierarchy of git repositories that goes to Linus, if you
think he's an idiot and want to take it a different direction, it's
easy to do that--and if he decides you have a good idea in the end, he
can merge with you without huge amounts of effort.<p>Collins-Sussman has been concerned, publically, that there's some
splintering process that DVCSes enable and that SVN prevents.  But
this perception is one you can only arrive at if you are in control of
the SVN repository--if you are trying to submit patches to somebody
doing this, and you don't have write access on the SVN server for
branches or whatever (which imposes a nontrivial amount of effort),
you more or less have to do this splintering on your own, without any
tool support.  In my experience DVCSes don't make this any more common
than it was once; it's just that now these private splinters are
visible, and can be integrated.<p>Another secondary thing that's very convenient for me is that I can
make many small changes and push them all at once when I'm happy with
them--because they're small they're easier to review.  But this is a

This ordering is much less useful in general, so I chose to make the alphabet the first parameter.<p>On a side note, our language also has some time series extensions for dataflow programming.  There&#x27;s an API for efficiently adding new data flows based on something similar to template specialization, but the API is unwieldy and the source of much confusion.

I went through a body scanner on a trip within Europe about a year or two ago. There was no random selection, they were just forcing everyone through the machine (I assume it was an x-ray but didn't actually have time to check). This machine was of the variety that did not have an operator viewing the images in a private room, but the operator standing at the machine had a display mounted on the machine itself (some parts of Europe are much less fussy about nudity). When I went through, the image was indistinct but showed "concealments" all over me (I was also permitted to see the image). The guy looked concerned and started to pat me down so he could figure out what these "concealments" were. After twenty seconds or so it was clear to him that I had no concealments and he confidently pronounced that the machines actually don't work if you are sweaty. Hilariously, a full bottle of water went through the (bag) X-ray machine unnoticed in my backpack. I pointed it out and they were kind enough to accept that I had left it in my bag accidentally and let me have it confiscated instead of what ever else it is they do with someone who has bottles of dangerous liquids like water in their bags. Since that humiliating experience I have travelled by plane in Europe as little as possible, taking the Eurostar train wherever practical. I do not travel to the US any more for any reason.

I got my rejection email yesterday.  I thought I'd be more disappointed at getting turned down, but I'm not.  It's actually motivated me to step out on my own.  <p>One of the big reasons that YC exists is to mentor young entrepreneurs.  I would love to have a mentor, but I think that I"m going to branch out on my own to find them, instead of drowning in the crowd at Start-up school to exchange three words with  Jessica or Paul.  Instead, I've been considering volunteering at the Computer History Museum in Mountain View to hang out with some elder geeks.  The Computer History Museum has a bunch of volunteer hardware/software hackers who restore vintage main-frames.  These are all really smart hackers who have spent decades in the tech business, and they are spending time in retirement doing geek stuff, because they love it.  These are the kind of people that I want to spend time with.<p>My team and I just moved to Silicon Valley this past year, and we're setting up out entire lives around the idea of having a series of start-ups.  We've driven a combined total of 12 thousand miles to get here.  We're set up financially so we can afford to iterate through start-up ideas without breaking the bank.  We have a great space to work in, and we're meeting a lot of cool people.  I actually talked with a man a few weeks ago who knew William Shockley of Shockley Semiconductor fame.  <p>Yeah, It's been a hard road just to get to Silicon Valley.  I'm sad that I didn't get in to the startup school.  But, I'm sure that I'm going to get a lot more rejections throughout my career as an entrepreneur.  If I wanted something easy, I'd choose a different career.   I'm doing this because I enjoy the challenge.  I'm doing this because I love technology.  I'm doing this because I love the game, and I'm in it for the long haul.

I didn't see an easily-accessible feedback link (note to other startup founders: include this), so I'll post my feedback here:<p>1. Congratulations.  In two days, you have managed to create a community more fucked up than YouTube.<p>2. I started watching <i>because</i> of the outrageous stuff other viewers were doing.  When you go to curb the abuse, be aware of this.  Many of your viewers may be watching only because folks are doing stupid stuff like ordering pizza and making yCombinator pay for it.  Lose the hassles and you may lose the audience.<p>3. Reality TV shows succeed because they're <i>unreal</i>.  TV execs hype up and dramatize all sorts of conflict, because that's what gets viewers to tune in.  Nobody wants to see an ordinary person's life, because it's <i>boring</i>.<p>4. Who do you want to be - Anna Nicole Smith or Paris Hilton.  Your success in attracting viewers is proportional to how trashy you are willing to become.  Anna Nicole Smith and Paris Hilton remain media darlings because we can look at them and think "Wow, look how pathetic they are."  It makes us feel good about ourselves.  Unless you are similarly pathetic, people will not want to look at you.  Respectable people like Tim Berners Lee or Steve Wozniak seldom end up on the news.<p>5. If you <i>are</i> respectable and still choose to go on reality TV, you're setting yourself up to be torn down.  The justin.tv tagline is accurate: "An exercise in narcissism".  Narcissism is going to prompt abuse.  People think that since you've set yourself up on a pedestal, you've given them an opening to tear you down.<p>6. I initially had logged in watch the yCombinator dinner.  That proved impractical because of the technology: the audio quality was shitty, the video would randomly drop out, and you couldn't really see anything anyway.  Part of the problem for attracting a decent community is there's nothing for <i>decent</i> people to do.  That leaves it as a festival for troublemakers.<p>7. Have you guys not read Shirky?

always wanted to start writing a life journal for myself. But there have always been one nagging reason that kept me from doing so: the fear of not securing it properly, and having it <i>leaked</i>, so to speak. Naturally, a journal will contain intimate thoughts that I&#x27;ve kept from anyone else. And I intend to store more data than paper journal normally does: images, knowledge etc. A wiki about myself.<p>Now, I&#x27;m just another run-of-the-mill mid 20s programmers, I&#x27;m not on any list that I&#x27;m aware of. And you can never say anything about life, but I&#x27;m not particularly intend to join any list of a three digits agency, either ;).<p>That said, I&#x27;m not sure if my paranoid is grounded or not. My answers to the two basic questions on threat modeling: &quot;What&#x27;s the likelihood of a threat against the journal would be?&quot; and &quot;What would happen if the threat actually happen&quot; would be &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; and &quot;I hope I&#x27;m old enough&quot;. On one hand, I&#x27;ve no reason to believe that my info would be of anyone interest. On the other hand, I&#x27;d rather not find out whether anyone does.<p>I&#x27;ve been thinking about it for a bit, and the most secure way seems to be getting a secondary machine without network access, and just write the journal there. This approach has several problems:<p>- Collecting data: I&#x27;d have to actually transfer data I got from another machine to this one, via some air gap methods. This seems way overboard to me.<p>- Backup: regular backup won&#x27;t be a viable options, especially for redundancy in term of geography.<p>All in all, I&#x27;d prefer to have some security&#x2F;encryption scheme that I can use on a normal machine. Of course, the trade off will be security. I&#x27;m willing to accept that if I managed to be a named target of a 3 letter agency on a 20 person lists, they will successfully mount an attack for the data (I wouldn&#x27;t be able to stop them, either way). But beyond that, I&#x27;d like the data to be as secure as possible.
