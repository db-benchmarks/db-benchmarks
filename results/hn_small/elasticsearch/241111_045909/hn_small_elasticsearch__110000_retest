For OTA HD recording, one either has to be able to afford TIVO or spend a significant amount of time and some money hand-building a DVR system.","akeck","7","48","12"";s:13:"log.file.path";s:14:"/data/data.csv";s:12:"story_author";s:12:"selamattidur";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:12;s:8:"story_id";i:2867837;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:6;a:11:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:117;s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"fakeer";s:10:"comment_id";i:5916266;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:12;s:12:"comment_text";s:619:"I don&#x27;t know whether it&#x27;s a mistake or not but I see a lot of new location&#x2F;locality&#x2F;city specific apps&#x2F;startups coming out as <i>only in city A,B</i> or maybe <i>works only in the USA</i>.

An accident on the side of the road can immediately escalate into a multi-vehicle incident if another driver doesn&#x27;t pay attention.<p>What we don&#x27;t want to happen is for you, the hero, to become another patient. Not only are you putting your life in danger, you&#x27;re also increasing the risk for your rescuers as well.<p>What you can do is this:<p>1. Secure the scene. If the accident occurred at the side of the road, park behind the accident and turn your hazards on. Wave at traffic to slow down and be cautious around the accident. If there is a house fire, try to find the gas shut-off valve and turn it off.<p>2. Assist the location of the scene. It&#x27;s often difficult for EMS to locate the scene of the emergency. Standing near the front of the building or the entrance to the parking lot and flagging the ambulance&#x2F;PD&#x2F;fire down helps a ton. Leading them directly to the scene is just as important.<p>3. Use your common sense. Don&#x27;t let the panic take hold of you. Be rational, reasonable. I&#x27;m not saying you should never try to help someone, just make sure that YOU are safe FIRST before heading in to assist.<p>I hold EMT&#x2F;Paramedic certs and volunteer in my spare time.<p>Thanks.<p>Edit: I also want to point out that there is generally very little anyone can do aside from basic management of the ABC&#x27;s (airway, breathing and circulation) without equipment. Some of that equipment is located onboard a fire truck or an ambulance. Most of that equipment is usually found inside the operating room of your local hospital. The faster the patient is moved safely to the local ED, the better it is.","nathannecro","0","17","16"";s:13:"log.file.path";s:14:"/data/data.csv";s:12:"story_author";s:6:"gr2020";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:16;s:8:"story_id";i:8407083;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:12;a:11:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:1440;s:14:"comment_author";s:6:"mahmud";s:10:"comment_id";i:985451;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:12:"comment_text";s:1504:"Sales and marketing.

You just cannot sit down one fine day (read: end of the year) and discuss the performance for the entire year. Just does not work for human beings like that. We are good and bad on different days. Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on.

Some days, we are ultra productive, some we just slack off. I would rather have my team&#x2F;manager talk to me more often about what I am doing right when it actually happens. Same with what I did not do well <i>at the time</i> when it happened. This gives me the opportunity to learn quickly.<p>The end of year discussion in reality is more like &quot;I do not really know the details of what you did exactly but I know you were ok for the most part. Here is a couple of things you can change, blah blah. You get a satisfactory rating blah. &quot; That&#x27;s for most of us. A few unlucky ones get the shorter end of the stick &quot;We have to fire the bottom 5% and we thought you are one of those. Not much specifics specially compared to co-workers&quot;<p>I want real metrics and feedback to be incorporated in my review. Not the end of year survey sent to a few people I choose who will mostly say good things about me (hopefully). By real feedback, I mean the email that my customer sent saying &quot;You saved my life today. You are awesome&quot;. This email should be filed&#x2F;shared with my manager who will then know the background of why the customer said so. stuff like that is real feedback.<p>The biggest problem I see with performance reviews is the fact that there is no way to compare my work with my co-workers in terms of effectiveness, customer satisfaction and quality delivery. I m not saying that it should become a competition of who is better but there must be a  way to tell me that someone else did a better job at xyz while I was really good at abc.<p>&quot;It also bolsters accountability because managers have far more responsibility for setting employee compensation than under the old system&quot;<p>This. A 1000 times. It is sickening to hear the same old argument from your direct manager that &quot;sorry if I could, I would give you a better raise. But my hands are tied because I am told so&quot;. One huge reason why I quit working fulltime and became a consultant. You pay me what we agreed and I live with it. When my contract rolls, I might ask for a raise and if you decline, it is my choice to stay or move on. Either way, no one is forced into anything.<p>Couple of others useful links with details on this:<p>[0] <a href=""http://www.hreonline.com/HRE/view/story.jhtml?id=534355695&amp;"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.hreonline.com&#x2F;HRE&#x2F;view&#x2F;story.jhtml?id=534355695&amp;</a><p>[1] <a href=""https://blogs.adobe.com/conversations/tag/performance-review"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blogs.adobe.com&#x2F;conversations&#x2F;tag&#x2F;performance-review</a>","codegeek","0","678","16"";s:13:"log.file.path";s:14:"/data/data.csv";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"tmbsundar";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:16;s:8:"story_id";i:7196536;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:16;a:11:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:15;s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"gkefalas";s:10:"comment_id";i:1038662;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:12:"comment_text";s:1830:"In terms of medical advances, there may not have been any major blockbuster disease cures found, but there were several very important advances &#38; innovations.

And from what I can see the emphasis on usability seems to paying off for JASPER.<p>Model checking in software has been less successful because the state explosion problem is much more pronounced but there have been notable success stories like Microsoft Research&#x27;s SLAM project [7]. And I definitely think there is an opportunity here to build upon the algorithmic progress in automated verification in order to build tools that are much usable in a software setting.<p>[1] <a href=""http://ecee.colorado.edu/~bradleya/ic3/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;ecee.colorado.edu&#x2F;~bradleya&#x2F;ic3&#x2F;</a><p>[2] <a href=""http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/abc.htm"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.eecs.berkeley.edu&#x2F;~alanmi&#x2F;abc&#x2F;abc.htm</a><p>[3] <a href=""https://www.princeton.edu/~chaff/zchaff.html"" rel=""nofollow"">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.princeton.edu&#x2F;~chaff&#x2F;zchaff.html</a><p>[4] <a href=""http://minisat.se/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;minisat.se&#x2F;</a><p>[5] <a href=""http://fmv.jku.at/picosat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;fmv.jku.at&#x2F;picosat&#x2F;</a><p>[6] <a href=""http://z3.codeplex.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;z3.codeplex.com&#x2F;</a><p>[7] <a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/slam/"" rel=""nofollow"">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;research.microsoft.com&#x2F;en-us&#x2F;projects&#x2F;slam&#x2F;</a>","wsxcde","0","31","12"";s:13:"log.file.path";s:14:"/data/data.csv";s:12:"story_author";s:9:"dllthomas";s:19:"story_comment_count";i:12;s:8:"story_id";i:7618406;s:10:"story_text";s:0:"";}i:12;a:11:{s:20:"author_comment_count";i:356;s:14:"comment_author";s:8:"suprgeek";s:10:"comment_id";i:7485127;s:15:"comment_ranking";i:0;s:12:"comment_text";s:684:"This is tyranny sneaking up on us one &quot;No-XYZ list&quot; at a time.<p>They can put you on it for any reason (lets say you oppose one of the Govt. policies - Drone Bombings for example), you will be unable to find out why you are on said list or even if you are.<p>Since you cannot confirm that you are on said list you will not be able to get off it.

It was miserable and lonely but we were naive and still dreaming of get rich quick schemes. We decided to finally create Grooovy after months of brainstorming ideas and really felt a connection with it. Grooovy (http://www.grooovy.me) was designed to be a social meetup app for iphone that allowed users to meet over drinks, food or a snack within 75 miles of their current location. That was the key- it would really tackle the problem of not being able to meet people and just socialize especially when you're working odd hours and unable to meet anyone new outside of school or work. We wouldn't have to feel lonely!<p>We asked everyone we knew, even tried to find complete strangers to get an honest opinion. People were excited, we criticized ourselves harshly and improved on all the feedback/suggestions we got. When we were finally close to launching, we ran a series of beta tests which passed with flying colors. Everyone who had a chance to use it (Thank you again) thought it was a very valid and new way of socializing. It would be something new, a networking tool used for platonic relationships and not just dating. We spent extra time revising, bug testing, fixing whatever we could to the best of our abilities.<p>But then geotargeting happened. When we launched, we had about 3,xxx downloads starting the first few days- everything looked good. What we didn't expect was how far each user be from one another. A limit of 75miles is nothing when you're selling an app to the entire United States. We immediately got 2 reviews and a ton of feedback telling us that our idea was worth 5 stars but the app didn't work! The reason why it didn't work was because nobody was close to one another to see each other's events! This was a terrible mistake that we should've caught on. By the time that we launched a new revised update and let users know how many people were in their current area and fix what we needed, our app rank had plummeted to the 799th place under social networking. I'm still getting emails occasionally asking me when the app would be fixed, and it's ridiculous that I have to tell them that the App is working but there's not not enough people in their area!<p>At this point, I don't see much hope for recovery- We're at the end of our string and don't know what else we can do.

While it wasn't really a surprise (I kinda knew it was going to happen), it was a pretty painful experience.<p>Having said that, it's nothing compared to what I feel now. I sincerely, truly believed that my current startup had potential to grow but I lost the one chance I had. After failing our startup last year, we picked up on advice from HN- we started over. We finally found something we truly believed in and created our first iPhone App after 6 months. Given that we didn't have any programming or design experience, we worked like hell to really make up for all the areas we were lacking in. Were barely surviving by (we had left our jobs since the last failed startup) and working nonstop because this was THE idea we believed in.<p>One of the startup advice that I hear most often is to create a product that solves a problem of your own (37signals) because there's bound to be people like you who have the same problem. During our last startup, we sacrificed all the time we had with friends, family, and ignored our relationships for the most part. It was miserable and lonely but we were naive and still dreaming of get rich quick schemes. We decided to finally create Grooovy after months of brainstorming ideas and really felt a connection with it. Grooovy (http://www.grooovy.me) was designed to be a social meetup app for iphone that allowed users to meet over drinks, food or a snack within 75 miles of their current location. That was the key- it would really tackle the problem of not being able to meet people and just socialize especially when you're working odd hours and unable to meet anyone new outside of school or work. We wouldn't have to feel lonely!<p>We asked everyone we knew, even tried to find complete strangers to get an honest opinion. People were excited, we criticized ourselves harshly and improved on all the feedback/suggestions we got. When we were finally close to launching, we ran a series of beta tests which passed with flying colors. Everyone who had a chance to use it (Thank you again) thought it was a very valid and new way of socializing. It would be something new, a networking tool used for platonic relationships and not just dating. We spent extra time revising, bug testing, fixing whatever we could to the best of our abilities.<p>But then geotargeting happened. When we launched, we had about 3,xxx downloads starting the first few days- everything looked good. What we didn't expect was how far each user be from one another. A limit of 75miles is nothing when you're selling an app to the entire United States. We immediately got 2 reviews and a ton of feedback telling us that our idea was worth 5 stars but the app didn't work! The reason why it didn't work was because nobody was close to one another to see each other's events! This was a terrible mistake that we should've caught on. By the time that we launched a new revised update and let users know how many people were in their current area and fix what we needed, our app rank had plummeted to the 799th place under social networking. I'm still getting emails occasionally asking me when the app would be fixed, and it's ridiculous that I have to tell them that the App is working but there's not not enough people in their area!<p>At this point, I don't see much hope for recovery- We're at the end of our string and don't know what else we can do. I really needed to rant because this was something I had truly believed it, I truly worked hard for and believed that it wasn't just something stupid I created again on a whim. We tried to follow every piece of advice we were given, learned to be humble, continued to believe in ourselves but feel like all is useless now because we can't geotarget specific cities with the iphone like SF Bay Area or San Diego!<p>Edit: Sorry for the long rant, just had to let out some anger.
